<h2>INTRODUCTION.</h2>


<p>In the selection and arrangement of the Correspondence
contained in these Volumes, the intrusion of unnecessary
commentaries and political opinions has been carefully
avoided. The letters themselves are so lucid and complete,
that the interest of the publication has been left to rest
upon their details as far as possible. But as a collection of
communications of this confidential nature, written from
day to day upon passing events, must necessarily involve
numerous allusions which, intelligible at the time, are
either obscure or liable to misapprehension now, occasional
notices of the principal topics and circumstances referred
to have been introduced wherever they appeared to be
required. By the help of this illustrative frame-work a
certain degree of continuity has been attempted to be
preserved, so that the reader will have no difficulty in
blending these materials into the history of the period
they embrace.</p>

<p>As no inconsiderable portion of the Correspondence contained
in these volumes relates to the structure and conduct
of Cabinets, throwing light upon public affairs from those
secret recesses to which historians rarely have access, it
may be useful, by way of introduction, to glance at certain
circumstances which, during the period embraced in the
work, exercised a special influence over the Government of
the country: an influence no less directly felt in the
councils of Ministers than in the measures and combinations
of the Opposition.</p>

<p>The history of Administration in the reign of George III.
presents some peculiarities which distinguish it in a very
striking degree from that of most other reigns. The key<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
to these peculiarities will be found in the personal character
of the Sovereign. To that character, and its immediate
action upon political parties, may be traced, to a greater
extent than has been hitherto suspected, the parliamentary
agitation and ministerial difficulties which were spread
over nearly the whole of that long and eventful period.
The means of forming an accurate judgment on matters
of this nature exist only in confidential details, such as are
disclosed in the collection of letters now for the first time
laid before the public. In order, however, to render intelligible
the allusions that are scattered through them,
and to point out their real value as materials for the
political history of the time, it is necessary to offer a few
preliminary remarks on the circumstances to which reference
has been made.</p>

<p>George III.&mdash;whose admirable business habits and inflexible
integrity inspired the highest deference and attachment
amongst the personal friends he admitted to his
confidence&mdash;was remarkable in no one particular more
than in his jealousy of the prerogatives of the Crown. He
carried his zeal in that matter so far as even to draw upon
himself the charge of desiring to strain the rights of the
Crown beyond constitutional limitations. But as these
limitations have never been accurately defined, and as it
has always been difficult to prescribe the precise privileges
which would relieve the Sovereign, on the one hand, from
being a mere state puppet, without giving him, on the
other, too great a preponderance of executive power, we
need not discuss the justice of an imputation which refers
to the general complexion of the King's views rather than<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
to any particular acts of arbitrary authority. That it
was the great aim of His Majesty's life to preserve the
royal prerogatives from encroachment is undeniable; but
it should be remembered that when George III. ascended
the throne, the relative powers and responsibilities of the
Sovereign and his advisers were not so clearly marked or
so well understood as they are at present; and if His
Majesty's jealousy of the rights which he believed to be
vested in his person led him to trespass upon the independence
of his servants, or to resist what he considered
the extreme demands of the Parliament, it was an error
against the excesses of which our Constitution affords the
easiest and simplest means of redress.</p>

<p>Intimately conversant with official routine, and thoroughly
master of the details of every department of the
Government, he acquired a familiar knowledge of all the
appointments in the gift of the Ministry, and reserved to
himself the right of controlling them. Nor was this
monopoly of patronage confined to offices of importance or
considerable emolument; it descended even to commissions
in the army, and the disposal of small places which custom
as well as expediency had delegated to the heads of those
branches of service to which they belonged. His Majesty's
pertinacity on these points frequently precipitated painful
embarrassments of a personal nature, entailed much
disagreeable correspondence, and sometimes produced
misunderstandings and alienations of far greater moment
than the paltry considerations in which they originated.
Amongst the numerous instances in which His Majesty
insisted on the preservation of patronage in his own<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
hands, one of the most conspicuous was his stipulation
with the Marquis of Rockingham for unconditional power
over the nomination of the household, at a moment when
the exigency of public affairs compelled him to surrender
other points of infinitely greater importance. We shall
find in the course of the following letters that His Majesty's
desire to advance the interests of particular individuals
interfered seriously, on some occasions, with the
convenience of the public service.</p>

<p>The same spirit guided His Majesty's conduct, as far as
the forms of the Constitution would permit, in his choice
of Ministers. He had strong personal likings and antipathies,
and rather than consent to have a Ministry imposed
upon him consisting of men he disapproved, he
would have suffered any amount of difficulty or inconvenience.
He prevailed upon Lord North to remain in
office three years in the face of sinking majorities, and
against his Lordship's own wishes, for the sole purpose
of keeping out the Whigs, whom he regarded with a
feeling of the bitterest aversion. Good reasons, no doubt,
might be suggested for this passionate abhorrence of
the Whigs, who, independently of party antecedents, had
given His Majesty much cause of uneasiness, by their
strenuous opposition to the measures of his favourite
Ministers, and by their alliance with his son. So
deeply was this feeling rooted in His Majesty's mind, that
when a junction with that party seemed to be all but
inevitable in March, 1778, he threatened to abdicate
rather than be "trampled on by his enemies." Four
years afterwards he explicitly repeated the same threat<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
under the excitement of an adverse division; and it was
supposed by those who were best acquainted with the firmness
of his resolution that, had he been forced to extremities,
he would have carried his menace into execution.</p>

<p>His conduct to his Ministers was equally steadfast
where he bestowed his confidence, and stubborn where he
withheld it. There were certain questions upon which he
was known to be inexorable, and upon which it was useless
to attempt to move him. Of these the most prominent
were the American War, Catholic Emancipation, and
Parliamentary Reform. Whether his judgment was right
or wrong on these questions, it was fixed and unalterable;
and the Ministers who took office under George III. knew
beforehand the conditions of their service, so far as these
paramount articles of faith were concerned. It was the
knowledge of this rigorous trait in His Majesty's character,
that made the Marquis of Rockingham insist upon submitting
to the King a programme of the policy he intended
to pursue before he would consent to enter upon the
Government in 1782. His Majesty desired nothing more
than a list of the persons Lord Rockingham wished to
propose for the Cabinet; but Lord Rockingham thought
that something more was necessary to his own security
and independence. He considered that when a statesman
undertakes the duties of Administration, he assumes a
responsibility irrespective of the Sovereign, and that his duty
requires of him that he shall lay before His Majesty, in
the first instance, as the basis of negotiation, an outline of
the measures by which alone he can conduct the affairs of
the kingdom with honour and success. In the adoption<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
of this clear and candid line of procedure there was no
coercion on the Sovereign, who was free to accept or
reject the propositions, while the constitutional principle
at stake was acknowledged and vindicated on both sides.</p>

<p>His Majesty's immobility on certain questions had the
practical effect of literally placing them in abeyance in the
councils of his Ministers. As it was found to be impossible
to form a strong Administration that should unanimously
agree with His Majesty, and at the same time possess the
confidence of the country, no alternative remained but to
enter into a tacit arrangement, by which those questions
were to be dropped out of the list of what were called
Cabinet measures, each Minister being left at liberty to
vote upon them as he pleased, without being held to have
compromised the opinions of the Government. Had it
not been for such an arrangement as this, Pitt, who was
pledged to the relief of the Catholics from their disabilities,
could never have held office under George III. And
thus was introduced into the practice of Administration a
principle which is undoubtedly a violation of its theory,
and which, taking advantage of a dangerous precedent, has
been acted upon since with less justification.</p>

<p>In the invention of this escape for the conscience of the
King through the side vent of "open questions," the
direct influence of the Sovereign upon the councils of the
Administration may be clearly traced. There were no
other means of reconciling His Majesty to the appointment
of a Cabinet, demanded by the voice of the Parliament
and the country. The dilemma was obvious. There
was no choice between the rejection of Ministers who held<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
certain doctrines adverse to His Majesty's convictions, and
compromise upon the points of difference. When it was
found impossible to conduct the Government of the kingdom
with a Cabinet that did not possess the popular confidence,
the Sovereign was reduced to the necessity of treating
with men who did possess that confidence, whether he
agreed with them in opinion or not. In our own times,
and under most of the Sovereigns who have filled the
throne since our Constitution may be said to have been
settled, there could be no great difficulty in a case of this
kind. Ministers undertaking office under such circumstances
would be responsible to the country for their
policy, and the Sovereign would feel himself at once
relieved by that responsibility from all further anxiety.
But George III. took that responsibility upon himself in
reference to the great measures that occupied the public
mind; and when, by the exigency of circumstances, Ministers
were pressed upon him from whose views he dissented,
he accepted them upon conditions which restrained the
action of the Cabinet, as a whole, in certain directions,
but left its members individually free and unpledged.
Such was the origin of "open questions." It was a
compromise on both sides; and of course it must
always depend upon the extent to which this compromise
is carried, and the necessity under which it is resorted to,
whether it should be regarded as a sacrifice of principle on
the part of the Minister who submits to it.</p>

<p>Another novelty originating in this reign, out of the
same peculiar state of things, and resting upon a similar
theory of expediency, was that of the formation of a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
Coalition Administration, in which party differences were
merged in a common agreement upon a general line of
policy. As considerable light is thrown upon this memorable
incident in the course of these volumes, it is unnecessary
to dwell upon it here. It will be abundantly elucidated
in the proper place. For the present, it is sufficient to
refer to the junction, in a composite Ministry of hostile
statesman, as one of the singular results flowing from that
necessity of adaptation to circumstances which was rendered
unavoidable by the unyielding character of the Sovereign.</p>

<p>There were other circumstances which, combined with
the personal dispositions of the King, led to the strenuous
assertion in this reign of the prerogatives of the Executive
against the interference and control of the aristocracy and
the Parliament. From the date of the Revolution up to
the accession of George III., the independent authority of
the Crown can scarcely be said to have had any practical
force&mdash;scarcely, indeed, to have had any existence. The
Government of the country was essentially Parliamentary.
It was part of the compact with William III. A foreign
dynasty had been established, and the people naturally
looked to the protection of their domestic interests against
the possible preponderance of extrinsic sympathies in the
reigning power. Under William III., the claim of the
United Provinces upon the special regard of the Sovereign
was the object of national jealousy; and when the House
of Brunswick ascended the throne, popular vigilance was
transferred to Hanover. The first two Princes of that
House who ruled in England scarcely spoke our language,
and were so ignorant of our Constitution and our customs,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
that they could not be admitted with safety to an active
participation in the Government. The Whigs, who had
brought about these changes, preserved in their own hands
the entire authority of the State. The Sovereign was
merely the motionless representative of the monarchical
principle. But George III. was not an alien. Born in
the country, educated in its language and its usages, and
inspired by an ardent devotion to Protestantism, he
entered life under auspices that attracted at once towards
the Crown an amount of popularity which it had never
enjoyed under his predecessors. The qualities and dispositions
of the King were favourable to the cultivation of
these opportunities. Without being profoundly versed in
the philosophy of character, he possessed a remarkable
aptitude in the discrimination of persons suited to his
purposes. He had considerable skill (to which Lord
Shelburne bears special testimony) in extracting the
opinions of others, and turning the results to account.
If his mind was not vigorous and original, it was active
and adaptive, inquisitive and watchful. If his judgment
was not always sound, his convictions were strong, and
the tenacity of his resolution commanded submission.
An accomplished linguist, fond of business, and having
some talents as a writer, which enabled him to express his
meaning with facility and clearness, he was well qualified
to avail himself of the political accidents which contributed
to revive and strengthen the royal prerogative.</p>

<p>The Whigs themselves helped mainly to bring about
this struggle between the Crown and the Parliament, or
rather between the Crown and the "great families," to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
use Mr. Canning's phrase, who had hitherto absorbed the
power and patronage of the State. United in principle,
they were divided by personal jealousies. The long possession
of office had given a sort of impunity to their
pretensions; and believing that they held a perpetual
tenure of Administration, they were weak enough, at
every new ministerial change, to contend amongst themselves
for the prizes. These internal dissensions weakened
and scattered them, and prepared the way for those
experiments which were made, during the early years of
George III., to conduct the Government without their aid.</p>

<p>The effects were felt in an entire change of system.
The accession of George III. was followed by a <i>coup-d'&eacute;tat</i>,
which displaced the able Cabinet that had been
organized by the elder Pitt, to make room for the
Earl of Bute, who had the credit of being the author
of the scheme, and who was utterly incapable of
carrying it out. Independently of his want of the
requisite qualifications as a statesman, there were other
objections of a private nature to Lord Bute, which
rendered it impossible that he could ostensibly continue
to guide the councils of the Ministry, however he might
be permitted, or retained, to influence them from behind
the curtain. But his short essay at Government had
sufficiently disturbed the <i>ancien r&eacute;gime</i>, to leave in the
King's hands the power of choosing his Ministers without
reference to popular clamour or the will of Parliament.
The consequence was, a rapid series of Ministerial mutations,
throughout which the contest for power was
maintained on both sides with so fierce a spirit, that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
during the first ten years of the reign of George III., there
were no less than seven successive Administrations.</p>

<p>It was not till Lord North was called to the head of the
Ministry, in 1770, that the public uneasiness was allayed,
and a Cabinet of the King's own choice was founded in
security. Lord North was an especial favourite with the
King, whose extraordinary regard for him originated in
the promptitude with which he responded to His Majesty's
appeal, at a moment of serious embarrassment, when
the Duke of Grafton unexpectedly threw up the Government,
and Lord North consented to undertake it. "I
love you as a man of worth, as I esteem you as a
Minister," writes the King to him on one occasion;
"your conduct at a critical moment I can never forget."
The Whigs were readily reconciled to Lord North's appointment,
because he was not mixed up in their differences.
They preferred a Minister who had no alliances amongst
them to one of themselves, whose elevation would have
produced discontents in the camp. At first there was a
show of dissatisfaction, and some attempts were made to
foment the popular passions; but the dignified firmness
of the Sovereign, and the moderate bearing of the
favourite, speedily tranquillized the public mind, and
enabled Lord North to carry on the Government with
energy and success.</p>

<p>In his private character, Lord North was irreproachable;
as a debater, he displayed some valuable qualities&mdash;patience
and endurance, facility of resources on occasions of
emergency, great calmness and courage, and a playful wit,
which never startled by its brilliancy, but seldom failed of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
its point. He betrayed no ostentation or vainglory in
his position; never offended by any undue exhibition of
the powers he wielded; and restricted himself severely to
the discharge of his duties as an adviser of the Crown,
deprecating the title of Prime Minister, which he declared
was an office unknown to the Constitution of this country.
As a statesman, he never achieved a high or distinguished
reputation. The American war was the blot upon his
career; nor can even his devotion to the Sovereign entirely
excuse him for remaining in office at His Majesty's
entreaty to pursue a course of colonial policy which
his reason and his conscience disapproved. This was a
political fault, which no circumstances can palliate.
Others have done worse, no doubt, from meaner motives;
but the mere desire of serving the King does not absolve
the Minister from censure for having acted contrary to
his own convictions on a question of such grave importance.</p>

<p>Lord North continued to retain the royal favour until
he entered into the coalition with the Whigs. This was
a step the King could not forgive. No extremity could
reconcile him to a measure so repulsive to his feelings.
Yet the coalition, after all, was more discreditable to the
Whigs than to Lord North, who may be pardoned for
accepting it as a tribute to his personal weight, and a
recantation, in some sort, of all the odium the Whigs had
industriously heaped upon him during the whole period
of his Administration. If they really believed him to be
the base and dangerous person they had all along described
him to be, the shame was theirs for consenting to associate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
themselves with him, and to work under him in the
Government.</p>

<p>The Administration of Lord North lasted for twelve
years&mdash;from 1770 to 1782. The most important consequence
it effected, so far as political parties were
concerned, was to throw the Whigs into opposition, and
to draw the Tories into closer relations with the throne.
This complete exchange of position exactly suited the
principles of the two great factions; the loyalty and courtly
aspirations of the Tories (now that all hope of restoring
the Stuarts was at an end) rendering them highly acceptable
in the councils of the monarch, while the popular doctrines
of the Whigs pointed to the benches of the Opposition as
the appropriate place for a party which is always more
usefully employed in representing the people than in
exercising the functions of Government. Sixty years
elapsed before the Whigs recovered the ground which they
had lost under the Ministry of Lord North.</p>

<p>The American war&mdash;for the management of which the
severest reproaches were cast upon the Government&mdash;the
state of Ireland, and Parliamentary Reform, were the
principal public questions that agitated the term of Lord
North's Administration. Amongst the Whigs who took a
prominent part in these proceedings were the Grenvilles.
Connected by marriage with the Pitt family, and distinguished
by their own hereditary claims and high talents,
they exerted as conspicuous an influence out of office as
they had previously done when they had the reins of
Government in their hands. It will be necessary to
retrace briefly the political heraldry of the Grenvilles for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
the purpose of bringing the reader acquainted with the
character of the three brothers whose intimate correspondence
forms the substance of these volumes.</p>

<p>Richard Grenville succeeded his brother in the Earldom
of Temple in 1752, and took an active part in the
Administration of the elder Pitt (Lord Chatham), who was
married to his sister, Lady Hesther, the mother of the
"Great Commoner." He resigned office with Pitt in
1761, on the question of the war with Spain. This
circumstance estranged him from his political connection
with his only brother, George Grenville, who remained in
office under Lord Bute, as Treasurer of the Navy. Lord
Temple, espousing the cause of Wilkes (for which he
was dismissed from his Lieutenancy of the county of
Bucks) continued in opposition till he was finally reconciled
to his brother in 1765. He afterwards had a serious
difference with Pitt on the formation of the Cabinet in
1766; but a reconciliation having been effected between
them in 1768, they subsequently acted in concert except
upon the taxation of America, Lord Temple invariably
supporting the policy of his brother and the Stamp
Act.</p>

<p>George Grenville had been educated for the bar, and
entered Parliament for the borough of Buckingham at the
instance of his uncle, Lord Cobham; joined the Administration
in 1744, as a Lord of the Admiralty, afterwards
as a Lord of the Treasury, then as Treasurer of the
Navy, and continued in office at intervals till 1762, when,
separating himself from Lord Temple and Mr. Pitt, he
joined Lord Bute as Secretary of State. On the resignation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
of Lord Bute in 1763, he became First Lord of
the Treasury and Chancellor of the Exchequer, remaining
at the head of the Cabinet till his dismissal in 1765, after
which he never again accepted office.</p>

<p>He left three sons, George, Thomas, and William
Wyndham, who variously distinguished themselves in
the public service, and whose letters, chiefly those of
the last, in all respects the ablest and most celebrated,
constitute the bulk of the following pages.</p>

<p>George Grenville succeeded to the title of Earl Temple
on the death of his uncle, and was afterwards created
Marquis of Buckingham, and was father of the late
Duke of Buckingham. He twice filled the office of
Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland.</p>

<p>Thomas Grenville, who died recently at an advanced
age, filled several high offices in the State, and accumulated
one of the most splendid libraries in the kingdom.</p>

<p>William Wyndham Grenville, afterwards Lord Grenville,
was one of the most eminent statesmen of the reign of
George III., and, surviving all his great contemporaries,
died in 1834. "The endowments of his mind," observes
Lord Brougham, "were all of a useful and commanding
sort&mdash;sound sense, steady memory, vast industry. His
acquirements were in the same proportion valuable and
lasting&mdash;a thorough acquaintance with business in its
principles and in its details; a complete mastery of the
science of politics as well theoretical as practical; of late
years a perfect familiarity with political economy, and a
just appreciation of its importance; an early and most
extensive knowledge of classical literature, which he improved<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
instead of abandoning, down to the close of his
life; a taste formed upon these chaste models, and of
which his lighter compositions, his Greek and Latin
verses, bore testimony to the last. His eloquence was
of a plain, masculine, authoritative cast, which neglected
if it did not despise ornament, and partook in the least
possible degree of fancy, while its declamation was often
equally powerful with its reasoning and its statement. He
was in this greatest quality of a statesman pre-eminently
distinguished, that, as he neither would yield up his
judgment to the clamour of the people, nor suffer
himself to be seduced by the influence of the Court, so
would he never submit his reason to the empire of
prejudice, or own the supremacy of authority or tradition."
The character is accurately and justly discriminated; but,
however fully this searching panegyric is sustained and
justified by the public acts and recorded labours of Lord
Grenville, we must turn to his correspondence with Lord
Temple for the complete development of that sagacity
and sound judgment, that intimate knowledge of public
affairs, and that remarkable comprehensiveness of view and
lucidity of statement, by which he was distinguished above
his contemporaries in an age of great political characters.
This correspondence, extending over a long period of
years, is not less remarkable for the constancy with which
it was carried on than for the minuteness of its details,
and the freedom of its revelations. Written with the
ease of familiar intercourse, and in that confidential spirit
which was the exponent of one of the most touching
attachments that ever bound one man to another, it is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
no less valuable as a close, running commentary on the
events of the day, lighting up in its course the hidden
springs of parliamentary action and the policy of cabinets,
than it is fascinating from the teeming evidences with
which it abounds of a warm heart and a highly disciplined
and accomplished mind.</p>

<p>The Correspondence commences in 1782, when Lord
North, sinking under the odium of the American war,
found his small majorities rapidly diminishing from 22 to
19, then to the vanishing point of 1, and finally to a
minority of 16. Every incident connected with the war,
the taxes, parliamentary reform, and all other questions
upon which it was possible to raise a discussion, were seized
upon by the opposition to harass the Ministry. The total
surrender of York Town by Lord Cornwallis, with the
whole army under his command, to Washington, and of
the British vessels in the harbour to the French Admiral
de Grasse in the October of 1781, awakened universal
indignation; and, when Parliament met in November, it
became evident that, however resolved the King or the
Government might be to persevere in their policy, the
doom of the Administration was near at hand. Amendments
to the Address, pointing ominously to a change of
counsels, were moved in both houses by Lord Shelburne
and Mr. Fox; but nothing further was done till after the
Christmas recess, with the exception of an announcement
that Ministers had resolved not to send a fresh army to
replace that surrendered by Lord Cornwallis.</p>

<p>About this time, very early in the session, a motion
was contemplated on the subject, the object of which,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
as may be gathered from the following notes of the
Marquis of Rockingham, was to relieve Lord Cornwallis
from the disgrace that impended over him, and to throw
the real responsibility upon Ministers. The Marquis of
Rockingham, desirous of proceeding upon more certain
information than had at that time been received, appears
to have advised a little delay, and to have been of opinion
that if any motion were to be brought forward at that
moment it ought to have taken the shape of a motion for
inquiry. It is evident that the Marquis of Rockingham
was already collecting his friends about him. The name
of Lord Rockingham's correspondent does not appear, but,
from a subsequent allusion, it may be presumed that these
notes were addressed to the Duke of Chandos.</p>


<div class="blockquot"><p>THE MARQUIS OF ROCKINGHAM TO THE DUKE OF CHANDOS.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My Lord</span>,</p>

<p>Your Grace does me much honour in the communication
of the thoughts you entertain of bringing forward some matters
of business in the House of Lords.</p>

<p>I shall be very happy to concur in opinion with your Grace,
but I must say that I cannot at present think that there is
anything come to our knowledge in regard to the actual
conduct of Lord Cornwallis, as commander of a British army in
America, which calls for the honour of a vote of thanks from
the House of Lords.</p>

<p>The fatal event of the army under his Lordship's command,
having been reduced to the situation of being obliged to lay
down their arms and surrender prisoners of war, naturally
requires that an explanation or justification should precede
anything that could be declaratory of approbation.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<p>As I understand your Grace's proposition, I conceive your
intentions would be, that in thanking Lord Cornwallis for his
general conduct, you would at the same time state, that the
plans he <i>was directed</i> to pursue and which had been so fatal,
were <i>highly censurable</i>.</p>

<p>An inquiry into <i>the causes</i> of the loss of that army might
certainly be a very proper and becoming measure; and I have
very little, or rather no doubt that the blame and censure
would fall heavy on many of His Majesty's Ministers, if such
an inquiry was taken up, and tried by an uninfluenced or <i>undeluded</i>
jury.</p>

<p>There is a particular circumstance, which possibly, as your
Grace has been out of town, may not have come to your knowledge.
I understand that Lord Cornwallis and all the officers
of the army captured at York Town and Gloucester, <i>are under
a parole of honour, and on their faith neither to say or do
anything injurious to the interests of the United States or
armies of America, or their allies, until exchanged</i>.</p>

<p>Your Grace will recollect, that in the Articles of Capitulation,
much doubt has been held in regard to <i>the propriety</i> of one of
the articles, whereby Lord Cornwallis had left some Americans
(who had been in or had joined our army) to be at the mercy of
the civil authority in America.</p>

<p>Many Lords will think that some explanation of that conduct
in Lord Cornwallis is necessary; and I do not conceive that any
explanation could at present be got from Lord Cornwallis.</p>

<p>The Duke of Richmond having called upon me this morning,
I had the honour to go with his Grace to your Grace's house,
hoping that you were arrived in London. The Duke of Richmond
will be early at the House of Lords to-morrow, and
intends to desire the House to be summoned for Monday next,
in order to make some inquiry in regard to the execution
of Colonel Harris, at Charlestown, in America. I will also<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
be early at the House of Lords to-morrow, and I shall then
hope to have the opportunity, along with the Duke of Richmond,
of having the honour of some more discourse upon the
subject matter of your Grace's letter, and that it will not
impede your Grace's intentions of some conversation in the
House, on the loss of a great army.</p>

<p>I have the honour to be, with great regard,</p>

<p>Your Grace's most obedient and most humble servant,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My Lord</span>,</p>

<p>Having not gone to dinner till rather late, and my company
having staid with me till just now, I have not been able to
return an answer to your Grace's very obliging letter as soon as
I otherwise should have done. It also prevented my being
able to profit of the honour you proposed to me of calling here
this evening.</p>

<p>I will call at the Duke of Richmond's before two o'clock
to-morrow, and I hope that his Grace and I shall have the
honour of meeting your Grace at the House of Lords, between
two and three o'clock; I should imagine, any time before three
o'clock will afford us time for the honour of some conversation
together.</p>

<p>I have the honour to be, with great regard,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>THE MARQUIS OF ROCKINGHAM TO LORD TEMPLE.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Lord</span>,</p>

<p>I felt myself much honoured by the very kind intimation
which you sent to me by Mr. T. Grenville, that your Lordship
would not be unwilling to come to town, to attend in the House
of Lords, in case any matter was likely to come on, which
might appear to me to be of importance in the present miserable
state of the affairs of this country.</p>

<p>I should have wrote to your Lordship to have apprized you
of the motions intended by the Duke of Richmond on the
subject of the execution of Colonel Harris in Charlestown in
North America, and of the proclamation which had in consequence
been issued by General Green. I was very doubtful in
regard to the <i>probable day</i> on which the business might come
to be discussed.</p>

<p>On the Duke of Richmond's first mentioning the subject, it
came out that the Ministers at last acknowledged that they had
no official information; but as a vessel had arrived from New
York, and some officers had also arrived from Charlestown on
Friday or Saturday last, I thought it probable that on <i>Monday</i>
or <i>yesterday</i> we might have heard that they had got <i>official
information</i>, and that possibly some papers would be to be laid
before the House, and the discussion of the matter would then
have been fixed for some day, and regularly proceeded upon.</p>

<p>The event was different: they continued to say that they had
no official information, but chose to enter into a justification of
the whole proceeding, in part urging some accounts which they
said had been in a Pennsylvanian Gazette.</p>

<p>I am now to inform your Lordship, that the Duke of
Chandos, who had thrown out an idea of inquiring into the
causes of the loss and capture of Earl Cornwallis and his army,
has been wished and desired to move it on Thursday next.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<p>The Duke of Richmond, the Duke of Chandos, and Duke of
Manchester, and some friends, have been here this morning,
and have prepared the enclosed motion for the inquiry, and also
motions for papers which would be necessary. Lord Shelburne
and Lord Camden have been acquainted with the intention;
the Duke of Grafton is also in town; so that I should imagine
the business will be well supported. I have no expectation of
any success in the House of Lords; but upon such a calamity
and national disgrace, it surely will become us to propose to
bring on an inquiry. Perhaps we may learn whether the
Ministers intend to throw the blame either on their Commander-in-Chief,
General H. Clinton, or on Earl Cornwallis, or
(what some suppose), on Lord Greaves. The public at large
have a right to know whether the real cause has not arose from
the neglect, inability, or some other cause, in His Majesty's
Ministers.</p>

<p>As the business is now fixed for Thursday next, I have
taken the liberty of apprizing your Lordship by a messenger,
who I hope will arrive before your Lordship goes to bed to-night.</p>

<p>I wish I could have wrote earlier. I shall be very happy in
the honour of seeing your Lordship, which I hope may be soon,
even if your Lordship could not at this time come to London.</p>

<p>I have the honour to be, with great truth and regard,</p>

<p>Your Lordship's most obedient and obliged humble servant,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rockingham</span>.</p>

<p>Grosvenor Square,<br/>
Tuesday, Four o'clock,<br/>
Feb. 5th, 1782.</p></div>

<p>On the 22nd of February, General Conway moved an
Address to the King, imploring His Majesty to abandon
the war. After a protracted debate, which lasted till two<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
o'clock in the morning, the Ministers found themselves in
an alarming majority of 1. But they persevered in the
face of these disasters, and, sustained in office by the
tenacity of the King, refused to submit to the constitutional
warning of Parliament. Three months before, the
Duke of Richmond, writing to Lord Rockingham, anticipated
the obstinacy of the Cabinet, expressing his
conviction, that "no essential change of measures was
meant, and none of men if it could be avoided. When
I say the Ministry," he added, "I mean the King; for
his servants are the merest servants that ever were."</p>

<p>Nor was it only by protecting an unpopular Ministry
that His Majesty showed his resolution to exercise his
prerogative in direct opposition to public opinion. It
was in the midst of these accumulating defeats and
strong expressions of popular feeling, that His Majesty
raised Lord George Germain to the peerage with the title
of Viscount Sackville, in open indifference to the fact that
his Lordship had been dismissed from the army by the
sentence of a court-martial, and declared incapable of
serving His Majesty in any military capacity, in consequence
of his conduct at the battle of Minden. To such
proceedings as these Walpole refers, when he observes at
this time that "the power of the Crown has increased, is
increasing, and ought to be diminished; and it is diminished
a good deal indeed." The diminution of its power,
however, was visible only in the spirited resistance of
Parliament, in the motion of Lord Carmarthen in the
Upper House, that it was derogatory to the honour of the
House of the Lords, that any person labouring under<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
so heavy a sentence of a court-martial should be recommended
to the Crown as worthy of a peerage, and in
the successive motions which were brought forward in the
Commons to force the Ministry to resign.</p>

<p>General Conway renewed his motion on the war on the
27th, and achieved a complete triumph, his minority of 1
being converted in five days into a majority of 19. But
Lord North still clung to office, and it was not till the
6th of March, when he was beaten by a majority of 16
on the subject of the taxes, that he began to betray
symptoms of a retreat. On the 8th the motion on the
war was renewed, when Ministers, collecting the whole
force of placemen and contractors, obtained a majority
of 10, which was reduced afterwards to 9 on a vote of
confidence. The crisis had now arrived. The Earl of
Surrey had given notice in the Lords of a motion to the
effect that Ministers no longer possessed the confidence
of the country, when Lord North entered the House, and
informed their Lordships that His Majesty had come to a
determination to make an entire change of Administration.</p>

<p>This was on the 19th of March. But so far back as the
11th His Majesty had been in negotiation with the Marquis
of Rockingham, through the agency of Lord Chancellor
Thurlow, who detained his Lordship in the House for an
hour and a half after it had adjourned to converse with him,
by His Majesty's desire, upon the practicability of forming
an Administration "on a broad bottom." The negotiation
with Thurlow spread over an entire week, and entirely
failed on the plan proposed by His Majesty, who wished<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
to limit Lord Rockingham in the first instance to the
nomination of a Cabinet whose policy should lie over for
future consideration. "I must confess," observes Lord
Rockingham, in one of his letters to the Lord Chancellor,
"that I do not think it an advisable measure, first to
attempt to form a Ministry by arrangement of office&mdash;afterwards
to decide upon what principles or measures they
are to act."</p>

<p>The day this letter was written Lord North resigned;
and in two days afterwards His Majesty renewed the
negotiation with Lord Rockingham, finally agreeing to the
whole of his propositions, and reserving only the household
in his own hands. While these negotiations were
in progress, Lord Temple wrote to Lord Rockingham,
expressing his earnest hope that the "cards should be
dealt only into those hands where he so much wished
them, from every motive of public and private regard."
Before the end of the month the cards <i>were</i> dealt into
the hands in which Lord Temple wished to see them, and
the new Ministry was completed, with Lord Rockingham
as First Lord of the Treasury; Lord Shelburne and Mr.
Fox as Secretaries of State; Lord John Cavendish,
Chancellor of the Exchequer; Admiral Keppel, at the
head of the Admiralty; General Conway (much to the
King's dissatisfaction), at the Horse Guards; with the
additional strength of the Dukes of Richmond and
Grafton, and Lords Camden and Ashburton, Burke,
Sheridan, and Colonel Barr&eacute;, in other offices; Thurlow
(the only Tory in the Cabinet) still continuing as Lord
Chancellor.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p>One of the earliest measures of the new Government
was to negotiate a peace with America; and Mr. Thomas
Grenville was appointed upon a mission for that purpose
to Paris, to meet Dr. Franklin. The history of that
mission is contained in a series of deeply interesting letters,
which, independently of the flood of light they throw
upon the American business, possess a permanent value as
illustrations of the personal characters of the writers (especially
those of Sheridan, to whose rashness Mr. Grenville
makes express allusion), and as showing that, even in office,
the Whigs were not united amongst themselves. The
materials of which the Cabinet was formed, being composed
of the Rockingham, and the Chatham, or Shelburne
Whigs&mdash;two sections of that party which had never
cordially coalesced&mdash;was not calculated to work together;
but it could not have been anticipated that their personal
jealousies would have taken a shape so dangerous as these
letters disclose.</p>

<p>It is clear, from the singular facts revealed in this
Correspondence, that, while an ostensible Minister was
dispatched to Paris by the general action of the Government,
with the sanction of the King, to negotiate terms
with the American Minister, Lord Shelburne had taken
upon himself to appoint another negotiator, who was not
only not to act in concert with Mr. Grenville, but whose
clandestine mission seems to have been expressly intended
to thwart and embarrass him, and whose appointment was
without the approval, or even the knowledge, of the
Cabinet. How far the King may have secretly supported
Lord Shelburne in this breach of faith with his colleagues,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
we are left to conjecture; but the intriguing character
ascribed to His Majesty by Lord Shelburne himself,
justifies, to some extent, the suspicion that a proceeding
so bold and so full of hazard to the Whig Administration,
was not adopted upon the sole responsibility of the
Minister. Lord Shelburne said of the King, that he
"possessed one art beyond any man he had ever known;
for that by the familiarity of his intercourse he obtained
your confidence, procured from you your opinion of different
public characters, and then availed himself of this
knowledge to sow dissensions." (Nicholl's Recollections
and Reflections during the reign of George III.) This opinion, just or
unjust (and there is no great reason to doubt its justice),
was founded upon extensive personal experiences, of which
this sinister attempt to break up the union of the Cabinet
may have been one.</p>


<div class="blockquot"><p>MR. SHERIDAN TO MR. THOMAS GRENVILLE.</p>

<p>St. James's, May 21st, 1782.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Grenville</span>,</p>

<p>You are certainly one of the best negotiators that ever negotiated;
and so says the King, your royal master, who is going
to send you the fine silver box which you receive with this, and
which, with great envy, I learn is your property; and which,
if the serious modesty of your former despatch could have been
seriously construed, you would not have been entitled to.
Though I have not written before, have not my punctuality
and remembrance appeared conspicuous in the newspapers you
receive? These tell you all the private news, and all that is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
important of public you will have heard before you receive this;
so this must be a very short letter, and indeed the messenger is
almost going; and Charles has been writing to you, which is
another reason for my saying very little. Mr. Oswald talks
very sanguinely about Franklin, and says he is more open
to you than he has been to any one; but he is a Scotsman,
and belonging to Lord Shelburne. If the business of an
American treaty seemed likely to prosper in your hands, I
should not think it improbable that Lord Shelburne would try
to thwart it. Oswald had not yet seen Lord Shelburne; and
by his cajoling manner to <i>our secretary</i> and eagerness to come
to him, I do not feel much prejudiced in his favour; but
probably I judge wrongly whenever the other secretary is concerned,
for I grow suspicious of him in every respect, the more
I see of every transaction of his.</p>

<p>I am just told that the messenger is ready, so more in my
next. There is no particular news. The Dutch are got back
to the Texel. Lord Howe still off there, but nothing likely
to come of it. Sir G. Rodney, notwithstanding his victory, is
to be recalled, and Pigott is sailed. This I think very magnanimous
in the Ministers or very impolitic; events must
justify, but it is putting themselves too much in their power.</p>

<p>We had a good illumination for this news. You see how we
go on in Parliament by the papers; we were bullied outrageously
about our poor Parliamentary Reform; but it will do
at last, in spite of you all.</p>

<p>Yours ever sincerely,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">R.B. Sheridan</span>.</p></div>


<div class="blockquot"><p>MR. FOX TO MR. THOMAS GRENVILLE</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Grenville</span>,</p>

<p>If your letter of the 10th a little damped me in my hopes of
good effects from your journey, that of the 19th, which I have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
just received, together with Mr. Oswald's conversation, has very
much revived me. I send away the messenger, for fear of the
delays which Cabinets are so apt to cause; but I hope you will
hear from us again very soon, with authority to offer the Independence
as unconditionally as you can wish. Mr. Oswald
says that Dr. Franklin is much inclined to confide in you; if
so, ask him at once in what manner we can act so as to gain a
substantial, if not a nominal, peace with America; and you
may depend upon all my influence in support of his advice.</p>

<p>I hope you will not be disappointed at our adhering to our
first ideas for the proposition <i>we</i> are to make, rather than
offering concessions. If <i>we</i> are to offer, we think it is not for
us to throw concessions at their head; but if they do not like
our proposals, it is for <i>them</i> to ask such as may be reasonable.
If what they propose is really so, there is no doubt of our
complying; and if it is not, or they should refuse to make any
offer at all, it will surely be clear who was most in earnest in
his wishes for peace; and we must make the best advantage we
can of our situation, about which I begin to be more sanguine
than I used to do.</p>

<p>From your letter, there are surely great hopes of detaching
America; and from those we have just received from Petersburg,
there appears the most favourable disposition in that
quarter to enforce a peace with Holland; or if that cannot be,
to take a decisive part. And I know how much this disposition
will be increased, if we can fully convince His Imperial
Majesty that the failure of your negotiation is not our fault.</p>

<p>With regard to all your diffidence of yourself, we laugh at it.
If, in order to save yourself bodily labour, you want a secretary,
write, and you shall have one; but for any other purpose, you
want no assistance, but are allowed by everybody, and the King
in particular, to be the best writer of despatches that is known
in this office.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>

<p>Adieu. I envy you the pleasure of announcing the news
from the West Indies, with all the modest insolence which
belongs to the occasion.</p>

<p>Yours most affectionately,</p>

<p>----</p>

<p>Pray make my best respects to Dr. Franklin, whose letter to
me contained some very promising expressions. Assure him
that, in spite of all that has happened, he and I are still of the
same country.</p>

<p>St. James's, Tuesday night,</p>

<p>May 21st, 1782.</p></div>


<div class="blockquot"><p>MR. SHERIDAN TO MR. THOMAS GRENVILLE.</p>

<p>St. James's, May 26th, 1782.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Grenville</span>,</p>

<p>Charles not being well, I write to you at his desire, that you
may not be surprized at having no private letter from him with
the despatch which Mr. Oswald brings you. There is not
room, I believe, for much communication of any very private
nature on the subject of your instructions and situation, as his
public letter, you will see, is very sincerely to the purpose. If
anything in it admits of modification, or is not to be very
literally taken, I should conceive it to be the recommendation
of explicitness with Oswald; on which subject I own I have
suggested doubts; and Charles wishes you to have a caution
for your own discretion to make use of.</p>

<p>I perceive uniformly (from our intercepted information) that
all these <i>city</i> negotiators&mdash;Mr. Wentworths, Bourdeaux, &amp;c.&mdash;insinuate
themselves into these sort of affairs merely for private
advantages, and make their trust principally subservient to
stock-jobbing views, on which subject there appears to be a
surprising communication with Paris. Mr. Oswald's officiousness<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
in bringing over your despatch and other things I have
been told since by those who know him, lead me to form this
kind of opinion of him; but you will judge where this will
apply to any confidence that should be placed in him.</p>

<p>Surely, whatever the preliminaries of a treaty for peace with
France may be, it would be our interest, if we could, to drop
even mentioning the Americans in them; at least the seeming
to grant anything to them as at the requisition of France.
France now denies our ceding Independence to America to
be anything given to them, and declines to allow anything
for it. In my opinion it would be wiser in them to insist
ostentatiously (and even to make a point of allowing something
for it) on the Independence of America being as the first article
of their treating; and this would for ever furnish them with a
claim on the friendship and confidence of the Americans after
the peace. But since they do not do this, surely it would not
be bad policy, even if we gave up more to France in other
respects, to prevent her appearing in the treaty as in any
respect the champion of America, or as having made any
claims for her; we giving her up everything she wants equally,
and her future confidence and alliance being such an object to
us. Were I the Minister, I would give France an island or
two to choose, if it would expose her selfishness, sooner than let
her gain the <i>esteem of the Americans</i> by claiming anything
essential for them in apparent preference to her own interest
and ambition. All people, of all descriptions, in America, will
read the treaty of peace, whenever it comes, which France shall
make with this country; and if they should see there that she
has claimed and got a good deal for herself, but has not
appeared to have thought of them, however they may have
profited in fact, it would certainly give us a great advantage in
those sort of arguments and competitions which will arise after
a peace; whereas if it appears as a stipulated demand on the
part of France that America should be independent, it will for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
ever be a most handy record and argument for the French
party in that country to work with; and this, as things stand
now, and as far as my poor judgment goes, appears not to be a
very difficult thing to have either way. And so these are my
politics on that subject for you.</p>

<p>You will find Rodney has taken some more ships. The
unluckiness of his recal, I think, appears to increase in its ill
effect; and people don't seem to fancy Pigott. Rolle has given
notice that he will move on Thursday to know who advised His
Majesty to recal Rodney; and out of doors the talk is the
same. Charles gave Johnson, who had been very violent on
this subject the other day, an excellent trimming; but there
was a good deal of coy with the other.</p>

<p>The arming plan don't seem to take at all. We have not yet
heard from Ireland since Burgoyne took them over a constitution.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>There is nothing odd or new to tell you, but that here is a
most untimely strange sort of an influenza which every creature
catches. You must not mind the badness of my scrawl: and
let me hear from you. Does Lafayette join your consultation
dinners with Franklin, as some of our Roupell intelligence
sets forth? I take it for granted the French Ministers will
think it a point of spirit to seem rather less desirous of peace
since your defeat in the West?</p>

<p>Howe is still off the Texel, and the Dutch safe within.</p>

<p>What mere politics I write to you! One might as well be a
newspaper editor at once, I believe, as anything that politics
can make one: but all other pursuits are as idle and unsatisfactory,
and that's a comfort.</p>

<p>Yours ever,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">R. B. Sheridan.</span></p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>MR. THOMAS GRENVILLE TO MR. FOX.</p>

<p>Paris, June 4th, 1782.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Charles</span>,</p>

<p>The <i>public</i> letter which I send to you by Lauzun, is, as you
will see, of no other use than that of accounting for his journey,
and enabling him to carry to you this <i>private</i> one, of which
I had once almost determined to be myself the bearer; an
apprehension, however, that so sudden an arrival might be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
embarrassing to you, has decided me not to take that step, till
I had explained to you my reasons for wishing to do so, though
I should not care to write them, except in the full confidence
that they will be seen by no person whatever but yourself.
Recollect always that this letter is written in that confidence,
and I am sure I never can repent of having sent it.</p>

<p>You will easily see, from the tenor of the correspondence we
have hitherto had, that what little use I could be of to you
here, appeared to me to be in the communication that I had
with Franklin; I considered the rest of the negotiation as
dependent upon that, and the only possible immediate advantages
which were to be expected, seemed to me to rest in the
jealousy which the French Court would entertain of not being
thoroughly supported in everything by America. The degree
of confidence which Franklin seemed inclined to place in me,
and which he expressed to me more than once in the strongest
terms, very much favoured this idea, and encouraged me in
wishing to learn from him what might be in future ground for
a partial connection between England and America; I say in
future, because I have hitherto never much believed in any
treaty of the year 1782; and my expectation, even from the
strongest of Franklin's expressions, was not of an immediate
turn in our favour, or any positive advantage from the Commissioners
in Europe, till the people in America should cry
out to them, from seeing that England was meeting their
wishes. It was in this light, too, that I saw room to hope for
some good effects from a voluntary offer of unconditional independence
to America, a chance which looked the more tempting
as I own I considered the sacrifice as but a small one, and such
as, had I been an American, I had thought myself little obliged
to Great Britain in this moment for granting, except from
an idea that if it was an article of treaty, it would have been as
much given by France as by England. I repeat this only to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
remind you that, from these considerations, the whole of my
attention has been given to Franklin, and that I should have
considered myself as losing my time here, if it had not been
directed to that subject.</p>

<p>I believe I told you in my last, that I had very sanguine
expectations of Franklin's being inclined to speak out when
I should see him next; indeed, he expressly told me, that
he would think over all the points likely to establish a solid
reconciliation between England and America, and that he would
write his mind upon them, in order that we might examine
them together more in order; confiding, as he said, in me, that
I would not state them as propositions from him, but as being
my own ideas of what would be useful to both countries. (I
interrupt myself here to remind you of the obligation I must
put you under not to mention this). For this very interesting
communication, which I had long laboured to get, he fixed
the fourth day, which was last Saturday; but on Friday
morning, Mr. Oswald came, and having given me your letters,
he went immediately to Franklin, to carry some to him. I
kept my appointment at Passy the next morning, and in order
to give Franklin the greatest confidence, and at the same time,
too, not knowing how much Mr. Oswald might have told
him, I began with saying, that though under the difficulty
which M. de Ve. and he himself had made to my full power, it
was not the moment as a politician, perhaps, to make farther
explanations till that difficulty should be relieved; yet, to show
him the confidence I put in him, I would begin by telling him
that I was authorized to offer the independence in the first
instance, instead of making it an article of general treaty. He
expressed great satisfaction at this, especially, he said, because,
by having done otherwise, we should have seemed to have
considered America as in the same degree of connection with
France which she had been under with us; whereas, America<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
wished to be considered as a power, free and clear to all the
world. But when I came to lead the discourse to the subject
which he had promised four days before, I was a good deal
mortified to find him put it off altogether till he should be
more ready; and notwithstanding my reminding him of his
promise, he only answered that it should be in some days.
What passed between Mr. Oswald and me will explain to you
the reason of this disappointment.</p>

<p>Mr. Oswald told me that Lord Shelburne had proposed to
him, when last in England, to take a commission to treat with
the American Ministers; that upon his mentioning it to
Franklin now, it seemed perfectly agreeable to him, and even
to be what he had very much wished; Mr. Oswald adding that
he wished only to assist the business, and had no other view;
he mixed with this a few regrets that there should be any
difference between the two offices; and when I asked upon what
subject, he said, owing to the Buckingham party being too ready
to give up everything.</p>

<p>You will observe though, for it is on that account that I give
you this narrative, that this intended appointment has effectually
stopped Franklin's mouth to me; and that when he is told
that Mr. Oswald is to be the Commissioner to treat with him,
it is but natural that he should reserve his confidence for the
quarter so pointed out to him; nor does this secret seem only
known to Franklin; as Lafayette said, laughing, yesterday,
that he had just left <i>Lord Shelburne's ambassador</i> at Passy.
Indeed, this is not the first moment of a separate and private
negotiation; for Mr. Oswald, suspecting, by something that
I dropped, that Franklin had talked to me about Canada,
(though, by the bye, he never had), told me this circumstance
as follows. When he was in England, the last time but one,
he carried with him a paper, entrusted to him by Franklin,
under condition that it should be shown only to Lord Shelburne,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
and returned into his own hands at Passy; this paper,
under the title of "Notes of a Conversation," contained an idea
of Canada being spontaneously ceded by England to the Thirteen
Provinces, in order that Congress might sell the unappropriated
lands, and make a fund thereby, in order to compensate the
damages done by the English army, and even those sustained
too by the royalists. This paper, given with many precautions,
for fear of its being known to the French Court, to whom
it was supposed not to be agreeable, Mr. Oswald showed to
Lord Shelburne, who, after keeping it a day, as Mr. Oswald
supposes to show to the King, returned it to him, and it was
by him brought back to Franklin.</p>

<p>I say nothing to the proposition itself, to the impolicy of
bringing a strange neighbourhood to the Newfoundland Fishery,
or to the little reason that England would naturally see in
having lost thirteen provinces to give away a fourteenth; but I
mention it to show you an early trace of separate negotiation,
which perhaps you did not before know. Under these circumstances,
I felt very much tempted to go over and explain them
to you <i>viv&acirc; voce</i> rather than by letter, and I must say, with the
farther intention of suggesting to you the only idea that seems
likely to answer your purpose, and it is this: the Spanish
Ambassador will in a day or two have the powers from his
Court; the Americans are here, so are the French; why should
you not consider this then as a Congress in full form, and send
here a person of rank, such as Lord Fitzwilliam, if he would
come, so as to have the whole negotiation in the hands of one
person; you would by that means recover within your compass
the essential part which is now out of it; nor do I see how
Lord Shelburne could object to such an appointment, which
would in every respect very much facilitate the business. Let
me press this a little strongly to you, for another reason: you
may depend upon it, people here have already got an idea of a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
difference between the two offices, and consider how much that
idea will be assisted by the embarrassments arising from two
people negotiating to the same purpose, but under different and
differing authorities, concealing and disguising from each other
what with the best intentions they could hardly make known,
and common enough to each. I am almost afraid of pressing
this as strongly as I should, for fear you should think me
writing peevishly; but if I did not state the thing to you
in the situation in which I see it, I should think I was
betraying your interests instead of giving attention to them.
I must entreat you very earnestly to consider this, to see the
impossibility of my assisting you under this contrariety, to see
how much the business itself will suffer if carried on with the
jealousy of these clashing interests, and to see whether it may
not all be prevented by some such single appointment in high
rank as that I mentioned; <i>au reste</i>, I cannot but say that
I feel much easier with the hope of making over what remains
of this business. I begin to feel it weighty, and you know how
much I dislike the <i>publicity</i> you packed off to me in that confounded
silver box; I could not bring myself to say anything
civil about it in my last letter, and you ought to give me credit
for great self-denial in not taking this opportunity of telling
you my own story at the Secretary's office, as nothing but
the embarrassment it might give you upon the sudden, prevented
me. Once more, I tell you I cannot fight a daily battle
with Mr. Oswald and <i>his secretary</i>; it would be neither for the
advantage of the business, for your interest, or your credit or
mine; and even if it was, I could not do it.</p>

<p>Concluding then the American business as out of the question,
which <i>personally</i> I cannot be sorry for, you surely have
but one of two things to do: either to adopt the proposition of
a new <i>dignified</i> peer's appointment, which being single, may
bring back the business to you by comprehending it all in one;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
or Lord Shelburne must have his minister here, and Mr. Fox
his; by doing which, Mr. Fox will be pretty near as much out
of the secret, at least of what is most essential, as if he had
nobody here; and the only real gainers by it will be the other
Ministers, who cannot fail to profit of such a jumble. Besides
which, upon this latter part of the subject, I must very seriously
entreat you not to ask me to keep a situation here, in no
circumstances pleasant, and in none less so than those I have
described. The grievance is a very essential one, the remedy is
Lord Fitzwilliam.</p>

<p>Adieu. I recommend to Lauzun to make all the haste he
can, as I shall not stir a step till you answer this letter, and my
step then will, I hope, be towards you. Sheridan's letter of
suspicion was written, as you see, in the spirit of prophecy. I
owe him an answer, which, by word of mouth or word of letter,
he shall have very soon. The news of the day is, that the
Cadiz fleet, twenty-six of the line and five French, are sailed for
Brest, but I rather imagine they have no authentic account of
it yet.</p>

<p>I enclose to you P. Guemen&eacute;'s offer of some good champagne;
if you choose to have any, tell me what number of
bottles, and let Brooks or somebody let me know how they are
to be sent to England. I don't understand champagne, but
this has a good character.</p>

<p>Adieu. Let Lord Fitzwilliam answer my letter.</p></div>


<div class="blockquot"><p>MR. FOX TO MR. THOMAS GRENVILLE.</p>

<p>(Private.)</p>

<p>St James's, June 10th, 1782.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Grenville</span>,</p>

<p>I received late the night before last your very interesting
letter of the 4th, and you will easily conceive am not a little
embarrassed by its contents. In the first place, it was not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
possible to comply with your injunction of perfect secrecy in a
case where steps of such importance are necessary to be taken;
and therefore I have taken upon me (for which I must trust to
your friendship to excuse me) to show your letter to Lord
Rockingham, the Duke of Richmond and Lord John, who are
all as full of indignation at its contents as one might reasonably
expect honest men to be. We are perfectly resolved to come to
an explanation upon the business, if it is possible so to do,
without betraying any confidence reposed in me by you, or in
you by others.</p>

<p>The two principal points which occur are the paper relative to
Canada, of which I had never heard till I received your letter,
and the intended investment of Mr. Oswald with full powers,
which was certainly meant for the purpose of diverting Franklin's
confidence from you into another channel. With these two
points we wish to charge Shelburne directly; but pressing as
the King is, and interesting as it is both to our own situations
and to the affairs of the public&mdash;which are, I fear, irretrievably
injured by this intrigue, and which must be ruined if it is
suffered to go on&mdash;we are resolved not to stir a step till we hear
again from you, and know precisely how far we are at liberty to
make use of what you have discovered. If this matter should
produce a rupture, and consequently become more or less the
subject of public discussion, I am sensible the Canada paper
cannot be mentioned by name; but might it not be said that
we had discovered that Shelburne had withheld from our knowledge
matters of importance to the negotiation? And with
respect to the other point, might it not be said, without betraying
anybody, that while the King had one avowed and authorized
Minister at Paris, measures were taken for lessening his
credit and for obstructing his inquiries by announcing a new
intended commission, of which the Cabinet here had never been
apprized.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>

<p>Do, pray, my dear Grenville, consider the incredible importance
of this business in every view, and write me word precisely
how far you can authorize us to make use of your intelligence.
It is more than possible that, before this reaches you, many
other circumstances may have occurred which may afford
further proofs of this duplicity of conduct; and if they have, I
am sure they will not have escaped your observation. If this
should be the case, you will see the necessity of acquainting me
with them as soon as possible. You see what is our object,
and you can easily judge what sort of evidence will be most
useful to us. When the object is attained&mdash;that is, when the
duplicity is proved&mdash;to what consequences we ought to drive;
whether to an absolute rupture, or merely to the recal of
Oswald and the simplification of this negotiation, is a point
that may be afterwards considered. I own I incline to the
more decisive measure, and so I think do those with whom I
must act in concert.</p>

<p>I am very happy indeed that you did not come yourself: the
mischief that would have happened from it to our affairs are
incredible; and I must beg of you, nay, entreat and conjure
you, not to think of taking any precipitate step of this nature.
As to the idea of replacing you with Lord Fitzwilliam, not only
it would be very objectionable on account of the mistaken
notion it would convey of things being much riper than they
are, but it would, as I conceive, be no remedy to the evil.
Whether the King's Minister at Paris be an Ambassador
Extraordinary or a Minister Plenipotentiary, can make no
difference as to the question. The clandestine manner of
carrying on a separate negotiation, which we complain of, would
be equally practicable and equally blameable if Lord Fitzwilliam
was Ambassador, as it is now that Mr. Grenville is
Plenipotentiary. I must therefore again entreat you, as a
matter of personal kindness to me, to remain a little longer at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
Paris; if you were to leave it, all sorts of suspicions would be
raised. It is of infinite consequence that we should have it to
say that we have done all in our power to make peace, not only
with regard to what may be expected from America, but from
Europe.</p>

<p>The King of Prussia is certainly inclined to be our friend;
but he urges and presses to make peace if possible. If we could
once bring the treaty to such a point as that, stating the demands
on each side to him, we could have his approbation for breaking
it off, I think it not impossible but the best consequences might
follow; and with regard to North America, it is surely clear to
demonstration, that it is of infinite consequence that it should
be publicly understood who is to blame if the war continues.
I do hope, therefore, that you will at all events stay long
enough to make your propositions, and to call upon them to
make others in return. I know your situation cannot be
pleasant; but as you first undertook it in a great measure from
friendship to me, so let me hope that the same motive will
induce you to continue in it at least for some time.</p>

<p>What will be the end of this, God knows; but I am sure
you will agree with me, that we cannot suffer a system to go on
which is not only dishonourable to us, but evidently ruinous to
the affairs of the country. In this instance, the mischief done
by intercepting, as it were, the very useful information we
expected through you from Franklin, is I fear in a great degree
irremediable; but it is our business, and indeed our duty, to
prevent such things for the future.</p>

<p>Everything in Ireland goes on very well; and I really think
there is good reason to entertain hopes from Prussia and
Russia, if your negotiation either goes on or goes off as it
ought to do.</p>

<p>I can hardly read Monsieur de Guemen&eacute;'s letter, but wish to
have two hundred bottles of the champagne, if there is really<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
reason to think it good. By the way, I beg you will remember
me to Monsieur de Guemen&eacute;, and put him in mind of our
former acquaintance in the Rue St. Pierre. If the wine in
question is as good as that he used to rob from Monsieur de
Soubise, I shall be very well satisfied. I will give Brooks
directions to acquaint you with the proper manner of sending
it. I am quite ashamed of dwelling so long upon this, after
the very serious business of this letter; but you know I cannot
help being a friend to the <i>poor abuses</i>; and besides, in a
political light, good wine is no mean ingredient in keeping
one's friends in good humour and steady to the cause.</p>

<p>I am,</p>

<p>My dear Grenville,</p>

<p>Yours most affectionately,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">C. J. Fox</span>.</p></div>


<div class="blockquot"><p>MR. THOMAS GRENVILLE TO MR. FOX.</p>

<p>(Private.)</p>

<p>Paris, June 16th, 1782.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Charles</span>,</p>

<p>I received your letter of the 10th by Ogg on the night of
the 14th, and would have sent him back as immediately as you
seemed to wish; but having no other messenger to carry
M. de Vergennes's answer, I was obliged to keep him till he
could be the bearer of that likewise.</p>

<p>I can easily conceive the embarrassment occasioned to you
by my letter, and have so much confidence in the honour of the
persons to whom you communicated it, that I am not under the
smallest uneasiness on that account; the explanation, however,
that you wish to come to, certainly has its difficulties; and
amongst them some so sacred, that unless they can be kept
altogether clear, you cannot but agree with me in thinking that
they must be buried at least in silence, though not in oblivion.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
In order therefore that you may see into every part of this
business, I will, as you desire, state in the most explicit manner
the circumstances of it, as far as I think they affect any confidence
reposed in me.</p>

<p>In the first place, then, you will have observed, that although
Franklin has actually made me no confidence, owing, as I
believe, without doubt, to the reasons I stated, yet as the
communication he had said he would make to me was of the
most confidential nature, and in full trust that the subjects
which he should mention should not be given as propositions
coming from him, I think it would be a breach of that confidence
to make it known even that he had promised to hold
such a conversation with me; and therefore to charge Lord
Shelburne with having diverted from me that expected communication,
would be to proclaim Franklin's promise to me;
which promise, though it has not been followed up, I cannot
think myself at liberty to quote. The delicacy of Franklin's
situation with respect to the French Court was, as he said, the
ground of the caution which he observed, and which, nevertheless,
he was once inclined to risk in my trust. He would certainly
have both to repent and to complain if anything on my
part should lead to betray even the confidential disposition he
had entertained. These reasons you will, I am sure, agree with
me in considering as decisive against any mention being to be
made of the expectations I had formed from the conversation I
was to have had with Franklin.</p>

<p>The Canada paper is not perhaps quite under the same
circumstances. The only knowledge I have of that is from
Oswald; and as I before told you, I had it from him at a
moment when I fancy he apprehended I had heard or should
hear of it from Franklin. No other reason, indeed, can
account for his not mentioning it from the end of April till the
31st of May. He told it me under no express limitation of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
confidence: the words in which he introduced it were, "I
think it right you should know;" and I am perfectly sure that
he asked from me no engagement of secrecy, nor do I conceive
myself under any with regard to him, except that general
secrecy which is always attached to business of a confidential
nature, such as was the business I related to you. I recollect
asking whether he had showed the paper to you: he said No;
but did not add any injunction to me not to do so; indeed, if
he had, I should have stated to him the impossibility of my
keeping from you a circumstance of that importance, or of my
becoming, by my silence in it, a separate party to a business
which it was my duty fully and entirely to lay before you and
to receive from you; nor indeed at this moment is the knowledge
of it confined to Lord Shelburne; as I am pretty sure
Oswald told me that Lord Ashburton was with Lord Shelburne
when he, Oswald, asked if he might give any answer to
Franklin about the paper, or rather observed that he supposed
he could not then have any answer to it. Under these circumstances,
the difficulty with regard to the Canada paper, of
which I have no copy, lies more possibly in the indelicacy and
perhaps bad policy of bringing forward Franklin where he
wished so much not to appear, than in the quoting it from me.
I do not wish to be quoted, if there exists the least doubt
whether I should. But I cannot more exactly explain to you
the whole extent of that doubt, than by showing you that it
does not exist in any specific obligation on my part, but only in
the nature of what was told to me; the subject itself carrying
with it, as you will see, many reasons for secrecy, and every
mark of it in the manner of conducting it; but as to positive
engagement or obligation upon this subject, I have none.</p>

<p>The remaining circumstance&mdash;of the intention mentioned to
Mr. Oswald by Lord Shelburne, of giving him a commission if
it should be necessary&mdash;stands altogether clear of the slightest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
shade of difficulty upon the point of confidence; indeed, at the
time I wrote you word of it, I did not imagine I was informing
you of anything new or unknown to you; and only so far
meant to dwell upon it, as to regret its happening precisely at
the instant when it was most important it should not. I
apprehended that Lord Shelburne might have already expressed
such an intention to the rest of the King's Ministers, upon the
ground of the American share of this business, which ground,
in the present stage of it, I thought possibly you had not found
it easy to object to. In this idea it was that Lord Fitzwilliam's
appointment occurred to me, not to prevent a clandestine
negotiation, but to unite a separated one; always imagining
that you knew of, but did not resist, the intended commission
to Mr. Oswald, and therefore hinting the expediency of superseding
it, by giving to another person an appointment of such
rank and magnitude as should include a power which it seems
neither for the public interest, nor for yours and your friends'
interests, to leave separate and distinct.</p>

<p>To return, however, to the point of confidence: upon this
last subject there is none; and you are certainly at full liberty
to proclaim at Charing Cross that Lord Shelburne told Mr.
Oswald he supposed he would not object to a commission if it
should be necessary; and that since his last return to Paris,
Mr. Oswald has told me he found it very much Franklin's wish
likewise. If I may repeat, therefore, in a few words, what I
have tried to express to you in a good many, it is that, as to
Franklin's first intention of a private and confidential communication
with me, I hold myself so engaged in secrecy to him,
that I think it would be a breach of confidence in me to have
that intention at all spoken of. As to the Canada paper,
I leave it, with the comment I have made upon it, altogether to
your discretion; and as to the proposed commission, you are
certainly at full liberty to say of it what you please. I have it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
not in my power to give you any additional proofs of sinister
management in this business. I seldom see Oswald, though
upon good terms with him; and have seen Franklin, since
Oswald's coming, but once, when he was as silent as ever,
notwithstanding my reminding him of his promise; so that
I cannot help thinking that business altogether irretrievable.
But neither do I know what you will gain by forcing Oswald's
return; indeed I am inclined to think it might be much more
prudent to save appearances by leaving him here, till you shall
have completed your purpose of receiving the propositions you
wish or the refusal you wish from Versailles. Perhaps, politically
speaking, you may not think it wise to make the conduct,
or rather misconduct, of a foreign negotiation the ground of a
domestic rupture, which may betray too much weakness and
disunion; but this is too delicate a subject for me to say anything
upon, more than to assure you that, whatever is your
determination about it, you will not find me shrink from the
part I have or may have to take in it.</p>

<p>And one word here about the desire I have expressed to
return to England: it is impossible not to say that I feel that
desire in the strongest degree. I would not speak peevishly
about my disappointment in the unlucky check that I have met
with; but I think you will agree that the real service it might
have been my good fortune perhaps to have been assisting in,
is by that check completely annihilated, nor can any step now
taken recover or retrieve it; and that consideration weighs
pretty heavily in a situation in itself not agreeable to me. But
if I repeat this now, it is to keep you awake to the earnest
solicitations I make of returning in the first moment you may
think it practicable; till then you need have no apprehension
of seeing me, but may trust that no personal motives, however
strong, can weigh against the important reasons you state, as
well as the desire you express, for my continuing something
longer at Paris.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>

<p>I am writing to you on the 16th, waiting impatiently for
M. de Vergennes's answer, which he gave me reason to hope I
shall have to-morrow.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>MR. THOMAS GRENVILLE TO MR. FOX.</p>

<p>June 21st.</p>

<p>I have been waiting day after day, and have not got my
answer till a few hours ago. I am sorry to have kept you so
long, but you see it was impossible to avoid it. A report
prevails that Bougainville is arrived at St. Domingo with two
ships, as likewise are the four that were at Cura&ccedil;ao. They add
that Rodney had been obliged to burn three of his captured
ships. La Motthe Peguet has twice had orders to sail from
Brest with his seven ships, and as often been recalled. They
expect Guichen soon with the fleet from Cadiz of thirty-two
ships: they are said to have sailed on the 4th.</p>

<p>Pray tell Sheridan to be more cautious in what he writes by
the post. If I had time I should give him a lecture; but I
want to send away the messenger.</p>

<p>Adieu. Oswald affects to consider me now as fully authorized,
but I believe expects different news as soon as the Independence
Bill is passed; but I cannot help thinking you had
better leave him where he is, for his going away will mend
nothing. I have bought your wine.</p>

<p>Ever very affectionately yours,<br/>
T.G.</p></div>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Within a few days after this letter reached England,
the Rockingham Administration had ceased to exist.
The Marquis of Rockingham, whose health had been
declining for some time, died on the 1st of July, and was
succeeded in his title by his nephew, the Earl Fitzwilliam,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
who is alluded to in these letters by Mr. Thomas Grenville.
The first intimation of this event conveyed to the Plenipotentiary
at Paris was in a letter from his brother, Lord
Temple. The circumstances that immediately followed
are detailed in the letters of Lord Temple and Mr.
Sheridan, written on the same day, and in a letter
from Mr. Fox on the day following. The apprehension
expressed by Lord Temple that Fox's resignation would
be ascribed by the public to a mean contest for offices was
not unfounded; although such a motive cannot be believed
to have influenced the mind of that statesman, the conviction
of what he felt to be his duty on this occasion
being shared by Mr. Sheridan, Mr. Burke, Lord John
Cavendish, Lord Althorpe and others, who instantly
followed his example. The King's undisguised predilection
for Lord Shelburne arose from the nearer agreement
of their opinions on the American question, than
existed between His Majesty and the Rockingham section
of the Cabinet, who were for an unconditional recognition
of the independence of America&mdash;a proceeding
regarded by His Majesty with aversion. The rapidity
with which the changes were adopted furnished a sufficient
reason for Fox's determination not to act under Lord
Shelburne, that nobleman having accepted the appointment
to the Treasury immediately on the death of Lord Rockingham,
without consultation with his colleagues, and Lord
Grantham being appointed in the same unceremonious
way to the secretaryship vacated by his Lordship. A
remarkable contradiction will be observed in the language
held on this occasion by Lord Shelburne, who is reported<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
by Lord Temple to have stated that he looked naturally to
the Treasury, and knew no reason why he should forego it,
while to Sheridan he declared that he entered upon the
office against his wish.</p>


<div class="blockquot"><p>LORD TEMPLE TO MR. THOMAS GRENVILLE.</p>

<p>London, July 4th, Twelve <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> 1782.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Brother</span>,</p>

<p>My letters by the post have been so unfortunate, and the
subject of the present hour is so important, that I have waited
all this day for the certainty of a courier, and I am now
promised that one shall be dispatched immediately. I was in
the country when I received from Mr. Fox an express with the
news of Lord Rockingham's death, and an earnest entreaty to
come to town; which I did, and found him anxious for the
future arrangements. I told him, in the course of our conversation,
that I held myself engaged to support the measures
of the body of the Whigs, and deprecated any precipitate resolution,
unless there was reason to imagine that <i>measures</i> would
be changed. He told me that a meeting had been held of the
four friends of Lord Rockingham; viz., the Duke of Richmond,
Lord J. Cavendish, Keppell and himself; that they had agreed to
submit the Duke of Portland's name to the King, for the
Treasury, but with little hopes of success; that he had writ
to other great peers, &amp;c., to come to town, and wished for their
opinions; that he took it for granted that Lord Shelburne
would insist upon the Treasury, and that the King would
support him in that claim; that his idea was to quit immediately,
but that others differed upon this, but that he was
to see Lord Shelburne, and should then know more. This
interview took place, and the first account I had of it was from
Lord Shelburne, who came to me in the House of Lords and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
desired to tell it to me. He stated general willingness to
accommodate, and a fixed determination at all events to adhere
to every measure of reform which had been proposed, and to
facilitate Cabinet arrangements as far as could be hoped from
him; that it was natural that the Treasury should be an object
to him, that he knew no reason why he was always to forego,
and stated the indisposition of the King's mind to any other
person at the head of that board. This was attended with
every expression of civility to me, and an earnest wish that
I would not decline employment, but would engage in the
King's service. To this I made the answer which you can so
easily conceive, and told him very fairly my intention to act
with the great body of the Whigs; I proceeded to state the
inconceivable difficulties attending our situation, the necessity
of union, and the certain consequences of a breach between
himself and the other great features of the Ministry.</p>

<p>I can hardly give you the detail of this very long conversation.
It was very free and open on both sides, and convinced
me that he was certainly, and at all hazards, to have the
situation, of which I hardly had a doubt before. He pledged
himself repeatedly to the public measures, and to a variety
of details which it is not necessary to state, and left me with
every personal expression and many wishes that I would reconsider
my answer. The next moment, Fox came to me in the
Prince's chamber, and I had nearly as long a conversation with
him; he stated his knowledge that Lord Shelburne would
succeed to Lord Rockingham, and his idea of throwing up. I
stated Lord Shelburne's promises to measures, which I found
Lord Shelburne had made to him; but the loss of the object,
which was evidently a favourite point with him, seemed to
affect him much. I repeated my apprehensions that the people
would not stand by him in his attempt to quit upon private
grounds, which from their nature would appear to be a quarrel
for offices, and not a public measure. He saw all this, and said<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
that it had been urged to him by several, but that he was not
<i>determined</i>. I went into the House of Lords, where I found
the Duke of Richmond, who was outrageous at the idea of
a resignation, and who went before me in all I had said to Fox
upon this subject; and you will easily conceive that this
opinion was strengthened by the most explicit speech that I
ever heard, which Lord Shelburne gave as his creed and the
test of his conduct, and which indeed seemed satisfactory to
every one who heard him.</p>

<p>This day has opened a new scene: the King declared his
intention of giving the Treasury to Lord Shelburne; and it
was proposed to Lord J. Cavendish to take the vacant seals,
which, from variety of reasons, Lord John declined; and notwithstanding
all that the Duke of Richmond could urge, Fox
has resigned, and the King has accepted the seals. <i>En nova
progenies!</i> Lord Shelburne keeps the Treasury, and it is
<i>supposed</i> that Pitt is his Chancellor of the Exchequer; Duke
of Grafton, Lord Camden, Conway, Duke of Richmond and
Keppell remain, and mean to go on; who are the two Secretaries
are not known. I have had a long conversation just now with
the Duke of Richmond, who is unhappy, but determined to go
on till the first breach on fair public grounds; and wherever or
whenever he finds Lord Shelburne tripping, he has apprized
him that he will quit, and the other has agreed to it, with every
seeming profession of cordiality; and thus matters stand.</p>

<p>My opinion, from all whom I have seen, is that Fox has
undone himself with the public; and his most intimate friends
seem of the same opinion. I am now to request and desire of
you, in the strongest terms, not to return from France till you
hear further from me. Fox tells me, that you (being envoy)
cannot come without the King's leave; and I must entreat of
you, for the sake of the public, and of that Ministry which
I trust and hope will still stand its ground, for the great and
important objects which we had in view in March last&mdash;let me<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
add, for your own sake&mdash;do not spread the alarm of returning
till you hear from me again, which you certainly shall in a very
short period. With every anxious hope and wish that affection
can form,</p>

<p>I am,<br/>
My dear brother,<br/>
Ever yours,<br/>
N. T.</p>

<p>I am anxious to inform you that the Duke of Richmond has
pressed me to take the Secretary of State, as named by all our
Whig friends; and I shall accept.<a name="FNanchor_1_2" id="FNanchor_1_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_2" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> This is another reason
for wishing you to stay till a few days clear up all our doubts
and difficulties, in which I need not say how happy I shall be
to see you so, and how cordially I love and esteem you.
Adieu, my dear Tom.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_2" id="Footnote_1_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_2"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> This first part of the postscript is written in cypher.</p></div>


<div class="blockquot"><p>MR. SHERIDAN TO MR. THOMAS GRENVILLE.</p>

<p>Thursday, July 4th, 1782.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Grenville</span>,</p>

<p>Knowing that you very much dislike your situation, I don't
know how to call ill news what I am now going to inform you
of. Charles has this day resigned the seals; as he is much
engaged, I have undertaken to let you know this event, and
make the last exercise of our office the sending a messenger to
you, as it would certainly be unfair to lose a single hour in
assisting you in your release. I understand you cannot leave
Paris without leave from hence, as you have the King's commission;
but by sending this to you directly, it will be in your
own hands to require that leave in as peremptory terms as you
please.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p>

<p>What relates to Lord Rockingham's death you are informed
of. The day before it happened Charles made a question in
the Cabinet on the policy of not reserving the Independence of
America as a matter of treaty and the price of a peace, but to
grant it at once unconditionally; on which he was beat. And
immediately on Lord Rockingham's death, Lord Shelburne
informs them that he is to be First Lord of the Treasury and
the King's Minister, though <i>against his wish</i>, &amp;c., &amp;c. They
proposed the Duke of Portland, which the King refused; and
after a great deal of idle negotiation, in which it was evident
there was no power left with our friends, the measure of to-day was
determined on. Lord John Cavendish goes out with Charles,
Keppel follows; but, to his shame, in my opinion, the <i>Duke of
Richmond</i>, I believe, will remain. Mr. Pitt joins Shelburne,
and will be either Chancellor of the Exchequer or Secretary of
State. For the rest, it is not known whether they will make up
out of the old set, or take all new. Conway also will stay.
But still, those who go are right; for there is really no other
question but whether, having lost their power, they ought
to stay and lose their characters. And so begins a new
Opposition; but wofully thinned and disconcerted, I fear. I
am sure, however, that you will think what has been done was
right. Fitzpatrick is here, but returning to Ireland; where,
however, neither he nor the Duke will remain.</p>

<p>I write in great haste, which you must excuse.<br/>
Yours ever truly,<br/>
<span class="smcap">R. B. Sheridan</span>.</p>

<p>What you hear of Cornwallis having lost some transports, is
a matter of no magnitude.</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>MR. FOX TO MR. THOMAS GRENVILLE.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Grenville</span>,</p>

<p>You will not wonder at my being hurried too much at this
moment to write you a detail of what has happened. I do
assure you that the thing that has given me most concern, is
the sort of scrape I have drawn you into; but I think I may
depend upon your way of thinking for forgiving me; though
to say one can depend upon any man, is a bold word, after what
has passed within these few days. I am sure, on the other
hand, that you may depend upon my eternal gratitude to you
for what you have undergone on my account, and that you
always must have the greatest share in my friendship and
affection. I do not think you will think these [less] valuable
than you used to do. I have done right, I am sure I have.
The Duke of Richmond thinks very much otherwise, and will
do wrong; I cannot help it. I am sure my staying would
have been a means of deceiving the public and betraying my
party; and these are things not to be done for the sake of any
supposed temporary good. I feel that my situation in the
country, my power, my popularity, my consequence, nay, my
character, are all risked; but I have done right, and therefore
in the end it must turn out to have been wise. If this fail me,
the pillared firmament is rottenness, and earth's base built on
stubble.</p>

<p>Adieu. Your brother disapproves too.<br/>
Yours most affectionately,<br/>
<span class="smcap">C. J. Fox</span>.</p>

<p>St. James's, July 5th, 1782.</p></div>


<div class="blockquot"><p>MR. THOMAS GRENVILLE TO MR. FOX.</p>

<p>(Private.)</p>

<p>Paris, July 9th, 1782.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Charles</span>,</p>

<p>You apologize for writing me only a few lines; I shall write
you still fewer, and make no apology; for after what has
passed, I count every minute that the messenger is getting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
ready to return, as so much time lost, however it is employed.
You are sorry you have drawn me into a scrape; I know of
none, at least none that an honest man could keep out of, or
need be either sorry or ashamed to have got into; neither
do I see what you have to regret in any part of this business,
farther than the late hour in which it was done. You know my
system upon that subject, and how firmly it was my opinion
that you should not have lost one moment, to fight the battle
with advantage, which, with or without, everybody saw must be
to be fought; but, as long as it is fought honourably, it is sure
to be successful in the end, for one day or other, right will
always come right.</p>

<p>I suppose I need not tell you that I have answered Lord
Shelburne's letter by the official information he desires, adding
to it "my fixed purpose firmly to decline any farther prosecution
of this business, and requesting him, as speedily as may
be, to lay before His Majesty, in all duty and humility, my
earnest and unalterable prayer that he will be graciously pleased
to recal me from the commission I am honoured with at
Paris."</p>

<p>I write too to beg my brother to press my immediate return.
I see by his letter he knows nothing of what has passed.
If you would show him my letter to you, at my request, under
the strictest confidence, he will be apprized of the true state
much sooner than if he waits till I come, when I shall certainly
tell him; this, however, is at your own choice, if you had rather
wait till I come.</p>

<p>Adieu. Pray thank Sheridan for his letter. I will write the
first moment my messenger is gone. Well, what a time
to be out of England! <i>et Montauciel n'y &eacute;tait pas!</i> I don't
think I can quite forgive you. No news here. They say they
have taken eighteen transports from us, but they are not yet
come into Brest.</p>

<p>Yours most affectionately,<br/>
<span class="smcap">T. Grenville</span>.</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>MR. THOMAS GRENVILLE TO LORD TEMPLE.</p>

<p>Paris, July 9th, 1782.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My Dearest Brother</span>,</p>

<p>Your letter was given to me last night, and since I have been
able to read I never felt so much agitated. I hastily send back
the messenger, but he carries with him a letter to Lord Shelburne,
in which I formally request my immediate recal.</p>

<p>My dear brother, you do not know my situation, or you
would see in the first instant, as you will so soon as I can speak
to you, that if I continued at Paris, I should be the meanest
and most contemptible wretch that was ever born into the
world; I should falsify my word, I should betray my honour, I
should repay the confidence that was reposed in me with the
most cowardly treachery, I should disgrace every feeling that is
honourable and respectable between man and man. I have no
choice; my immediate return is as much a duty and obligation
upon me as can in human society be laid upon one who would
not renounce the character of a gentleman. Judge, then, of
the distressful situation I must have been in at the time of
decyphering your last lines, and judge how sacred and indispensable
those circumstances must be, that do not give me even
room to hesitate in a difficulty of so much delicacy. I love you,
my dearest brother, with the truest and sincerest affection; my
pride and ambition are ten-fold more gratified in your situation
of life than in any that could be mine; nor, so help me God!
do I think there is an interest, an advantage, present or future,
that I would not gladly sacrifice for you, if it could add one
step to your greatness; but you love me too well not to shrink
at the thought of my disgracing myself, and a fouler disgrace
there could not be, than I should inevitably incur by staying at
Paris as Minister.</p>

<p>One part of my difficulty you see already; it is that I dare<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
not write even in cypher, what would save me all the embarrassment
of this letter, and you the uneasiness of its obscurity,
till I see you. My dear brother, reflect, if it is not too late,
upon the opinions we have held in common, upon the judgment
we have formed in common, of the rectitude and integrity of
some men, and the utter and absolute want of it in others.
Recollect, if it is possible, the uneasiness that you felt, the
doubt that you expressed and I made light of, in the very last
conversations we had together. Think over all that might have
happened, and be persuaded that all has; think over the most
pleasing parts of your last letter, and be persuaded that a few
plain words, whenever I see you, will make you blot it out with
indignation. But above all, I do conjure you, in the most
solemn terms, to guard against expressing the surmises this
letter may suggest to you, and to drop no word of suspicion or
jealousy till I see you. The caution of this letter&mdash;to which
I dare not add a cypher, however it must grieve me to speak to
you in the dark&mdash;every circumstance, must show you how
deeply my honour, how much more deeply than human wisdom
could apprehend, my honour is involved in this business.</p>

<p>One word more, though I think every minute an hour till the
messenger is gone. Trust me till you hear me; and above all,
if you are applied to persuade me to stay, do not think of so
doing; it may make the delay of one post, and that will hurt
me; it can do no more.</p>

<p>God Almighty bless you, my dearest brother; a warmer
affection no man can bear you. Think of all my impatience to
see you, and do not forget that in pressing my recal, you do
me a more essential and honourable service than you know.
Once more, God bless you, my dearest brother.</p></div>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Before Lord Temple had received this letter he had
declined the secretaryship, and accepted the appointment
of Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland, his brother, Mr. William<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
Wyndham Grenville (afterwards Lord Grenville) accompanying
him as Chief Secretary. In the reply that
follows, Lord Temple expresses the profound sorrow he
felt at his brother's determination to resign, of which he
was confessedly not in a position to form a competent
judgment.</p>


<div class="blockquot"><p>LORD TEMPLE TO MR. THOMAS GRENVILLE.</p>

<p>Pall Mall, July 12th, Eleven, <span class="smcap">P.M.</span></p>

<p>I have received your letter, my dearest brother, which has
sensibly&mdash;I need not say how sensibly&mdash;affected me. My letter
to you did not propose to decide upon the propriety of the
great question, whether you should or not continue to keep the
character in which you are now employed; of that I could
be no judge. The total and absolute ignorance in which I have
remained, since you left England, of what was passing at Paris,
and the total want of information of what was passing here, so
far as concerned your mission, make me wholly incompetent to
the question; of that you must be the judge, and I trust and
hope that your decision will stand every test. My object was
solely to prevent the possibility of your coming away precipitately,
and so far my point is gained. I will say nothing of the
cruel situation in which I stand; I feel it most bitterly, and
feel it the more because my affection to you has no bounds. I
am not Secretary at State; but think, my dearest brother, what
must have been my feelings, if I had (as was much pressed
upon me from every quarter) accepted that department to which
your negotiation was more immediately annexed, in confidence
that you would have done that for me which you have done for
Mr. Fox. If I had listened to that persuasion (and surely my
heart might have prompted me to have done so), I might have
had the mortification of finding myself in a situation which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
I can hardly think of without the most violent agitation; the
voice of every one had pointed out to me that department; and
every reason, public and private, seemed to call me to it.
Think this over, my dearest brother, and tell me if the ties of
private friendship are such as would have justified you to your
own feelings for fixing upon me a disgrace, the extent of which
I shudder at.</p>

<p>I know, I feel, that you love me; but, great God! to what
have you exposed me! and, much as you value Mr. Fox, am I
to think (good God! after the uniform affection, which has never
felt more truly for you than at this hour) that you trust your
honour and reputation in his hands to an extent that knows no
bounds; and that the moment which calls upon you to withdraw
yourself from your situation, is that which possibly had
put your brother in that confidential public situation in which
I trusted he had stood with you in private life? I cannot
dwell upon this. I would have fought your quarrels, I would
have felt with you every reason which may have induced you to
urge this recal, possibly very prudently, justly, and honourably;
but it was not necessary to convince every member of the
Cabinet, that your honour, safe in the hands of Mr. Fox, was
not so in mine. Good God! my dearest brother, loving me as
you do, and knowing how I prize and value you, think over
this picture of possibilities, and join with me (which is all I
will ever say to you on a subject which cuts me to the very
heart) in the happiness I feel, that motives, in which I will
say that considerations for your credit, your honour, and your
ease, were decisive, determined me to reject the first and to
accept a second proposition. That die is cast; my opinion, my
reputation, and my honour are pledged to it. I will believe,
because it is my only joy at such a crisis, that your affections
beat as highly to what conduces to my honour and situation as
ever I could wish; and tell me, my dearest brother, if the
whole tenor and every hour of my life has not proved to you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
how I valued your confidence, and how truly it would be my
pride to consult your advancement; and if in taking this
situation I have consulted what was most for the honour and
ease of every one of my family, if I have peculiarly consulted
the possible delicacy of your situation, and have sacrificed every
favourite passion of my heart to it, think what my present
feelings are, in the uncertainty of the extent of those sacrifices
which you may still think yourself obliged to make. The
thought, my dearest brother, distracts me; I hint it to you,
but I shall not feel a moment's happiness till I see you. My
letter is dreadfully incoherent, but it will paint to you the
agitation of a mind struggling for its dearest and nearest
object&mdash;the affection of a brother, whom from my childhood
I have pressed nearest to my heart.&mdash;I cannot go on.</p>

<p>I called upon Lord Shelburne the moment I had your letter,
and saw him soon after. I carefully obeyed <i>every injunction</i>,
and pressed your immediate recal. He stated the necessity of
calling a Cabinet, as he could not take it upon himself, and the
King does not return to town till Wednesday. I urged it with
every eagerness, and have prevailed that a leave of absence
shall be granted to you to come away immediately, and this to
prevent public mischief. But it is understood that you resign
the commission on your arrival here. I have prevailed that
the messenger is to return very early to-morrow morning; and
most ardently do I wish to annihilate the next eight tedious
days. Feel for me, my dear brother; consult your reason and
your affection, and let me hope that you will feel that satisfaction
which every one of my family most earnestly feels at my
acceptance of the Lieutenancy of Ireland. You know what
follows, and you will have time to think it over; but I conjure
you, by everything which you prize nearest and dearest to
your heart, by the joy I have ever felt for your welfare, by the
interest I have ever taken in your uneasiness, weigh well your
determination; it decides upon the complexion of my future<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
hours. I am jealous and nice of your honour more than of
my own; but think that I have staked my happiness upon this
cast; and may God direct you, my dearest brother, to the
only answer which can convince me that your esteem and
affection equals that which I have ever borne you. God ever
bless you.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>MR. FOX TO MR. THOMAS GRENVILLE.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Grenville</span>,</p>

<p>I am exceedingly obliged to you for your kind letter; and
indeed, if political transactions put one out of humour with <i>many</i>,
they make one love the <i>few</i> who do act and think right so much
better that it is some compensation. I understand a messenger
is just going, by whom I send this letter; he will bring you
others, from whence you will learn that your brother is going
Lord-Lieutenant to Ireland. If you go with him as Secretary,
I hope you will be so good as to endeavour to serve my friend
Dickson, who by this change has for the third time missed
a Bishopric.</p>

<p>I called upon your brother yesterday, and left with him
the letters that passed between you and me, explaining that it
was at your desire that I did so. I was very glad to have your
authority for this step, for to tell you the truth, I was very
much inclined to take it even of my own when it was supposed
he was to be my successor; now that he knows the whole of
the narration, if he still chooses (as I fear he will) to go into
this den of thieves neither you nor I have anything to answer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
for. If this transaction had been withheld from him, he might
have had reason to complain of me, but much more of you. I
have not heard from him since he has been <i>au fait</i>. His
expressions, both to me personally and to the party, were so
kind, that I am far from considering him as lost; but whether
he is or not, and whatever part your situation may make it
right for you to take in politics, I shall always depend upon
your friendship and kindness to me as perfectly unalterable;
and I do assure you that this consideration is one of the things
that most contributes to keep up my spirits in this very trying
situation.</p>

<p>Yours affectionately,<br/>
<span class="smcap">C. J. Fox.</span><br/>
Grafton Street, July 13th, 1782.</p></div>

<p>Lord Temple entered upon the Government of Ireland
at a crisis of serious agitation. A short time before,
under the Duke of Portland's Administration, a Bill had
passed the Imperial Parliament, recognizing in full and in
the most explicit manner the sole and exclusive right of
the Parliament of Ireland to make laws for Ireland&mdash;establishing
and affirming, in fact, the perfect independence of
Ireland, legislative, judicial and commercial. This Bill had
given complete satisfaction to the popular leaders. Even the
Volunteers declared themselves appeased, and adopted final
resolutions to that effect. But the factious and jealous
spirit of the Irish was subsequently disturbed by indications
on the part of the English Legislature of a disposition to
depart in some particulars from this settlement, and by
the unfortunate incident of some Irish appeals which lay
over for judgment in England, the authority to adjudicate
them having been relinquished, or disavowed, by the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
measure alluded to. The whole matter turned upon
distinctions, but they were sufficient to influence the
distrust of the turbulent, who were ready to seize upon
any excuse for expressing their impatience of English
authority. The introduction of a singular Bill by Lord
Abingdon, having for its object the assertion of the sole
and exclusive right of Great Britain to regulate her external
commerce, and that of all countries under her
sovereignty, and repealing so much of the former Bill as
took that power out of the Parliament of Great Britain
and vested it in the Parliament of Ireland, had the effect
of affording an abundant pretext to the uneasiness which
was now beginning to grow up in Ireland, and which
Mr. Grattan exerted his utmost influence to dispel. Want
of confidence, also, in the sincerity of Lord Shelburne's
Ministry yielded an additional ground for national discontent.
"Things were never more unsettled than they
are at present," Mr. Perry writes to Mr. Grattan, in
October, 1782; "some of the Ministry here are at open
enmity with each other, and everybody seems to distrust
the head." Such was the state of their affairs when
Mr. William Wyndham Grenville came over to London
to communicate confidentially with the Government on
the part of his brother, the Lord-Lieutenant. The
correspondence in which he details from day to day the
results of his interviews with Ministers, and his observations
upon the net-work of small difficulties in which he
was involved by the want of unity in the Cabinet&mdash;especially
between Mr. Townshend and Lord Shelburne
on the Irish questions&mdash;is minute and voluminous; and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
only a few letters have been selected from the mass to
show the course of ministerial diplomacy in reference to
the equivocal relations subsisting at that period between
the two countries. They form a running commentary
upon a curious passage in Irish history; and although the
circumstances to which they relate have long been completely
disposed of, the Union having obliterated all the
matters in dispute, the insight which they give us into the
detail of Cabinet discussions, the occasional traits they
bring to light of the characters of public men, and the
calm and luminous views they develope of the distracting
politics of Ireland, confer a permanent interest upon them.
Two facts, by no means unimportant, are established in
these letters&mdash;namely, the lively and judicious anxiety Lord
Temple and his brother uniformly felt in their endeavours
to restore the tranquillity of Ireland, and the impediments
they met in their strenuous efforts to preserve the faith and
honour of England in her transactions with that country.</p>


<div class="blockquot"><p>MR. W. WYNDHAM GRENVILLE TO LORD TEMPLE.</p>

<p>Pall Mall, Nov. 27th, 1782.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Brother</span>,</p>

<p>I saw Townshend on the evening of my arrival here, which
was Sunday. Lord Shelburne was then out of town, so that I
was of course obliged to state what I had to say to Townshend
alone. This I did very fully, in a conversation which lasted
near two hours, and in which, to say truth, Townshend bore a
less part than I expected and could have wished. What he did
say was, however, very fair and explicit. He expressed a
strong determination in the King's servants to give you every
possible support. He had found <i>no</i> opportunity (as I understood<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
him) of convening a Cabinet on the affairs of Ireland, but
had talked separately with all the Ministers upon the subject,
and found in them no difference of opinion, except perhaps in
General Conway, whom he thought "a little influenced by
his nephew's pamphlet, and by his own natural temper, to look
towards further concession." He saw little difficulty in what
you wished; thought you best able to judge of the propriety of
the moment for such a measure; and said it was the King's
opinion, as well as his own, "that where there was not some
marked difference of opinion, the Lord-Lieutenant should be
<i>left to himself</i>, without however being <i>abandoned</i>." I stated to
him pretty strongly the effect of the ideas of changes of men
and opinions in this country. On that point, as far as related
to men, I could get little or nothing from him, although I
recurred to it more than once. At last he said that the same
effects were felt here, and would be so till Government should
show a sufficient strength and consistency in Parliament.
Scarce anything more passed on his side, except strong expressions
of personal regard to you, and a warm encomium on the
Duke of Portland, and the language held by him on your
subject, and on that of the state of Ireland.</p>

<p>He gave me hopes of seeing Lord Shelburne the next day;
but the great man was at his recess at Streatham, and was not
visible till yesterday. When I went to him, he began with
unbounded expressions of a determination to support you as
long as he had anything to do here. He understood that you
went in great measure at his request, and therefore he considered
it as common cause. He begged that his silence might
never be construed into indolence or timidity: the subject was
never off his mind. As a proof, he mentioned his former
silence, at which you was alarmed, and its being followed by
the most explicit declarations, in which you had professed yourself
fully satisfied. After a great deal more of such verbiage, I
stated your wish as to the dissolution. He objected strongly to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
the taking so capital a step till something was decided about
the negotiation at Paris. If the war should continue, it would
be necessary to determine on some plan suited to such an
event. But if we had peace, the advantages to Government in
Ireland would be great and almost infinite. Such an event
would throw the Volunteers upon their backs, would bring back
the army to that country and to this, and would also bring the
fleet into the Channel. He dwelt very much on the great
advantage of not being obliged to meet the Parliament till October,
and when I hinted at the possible necessity of a contrary
resolution, he argued strongly, and I think satisfactorily, against
such a measure. He then concluded the conversation, expressing
a perfect readiness to hear me again more at large on the
subject. Seeing that he would not hear any more at that time, I
ended with saying that I was not commissioned to state decisively
your sentiments on this very unexpected event, but that I was
sure you would feel much disappointed if a measure which you
thought so necessary was postponed without the most serious
consideration and the most urgent reasons. His answer was,
that you might depend upon it that whatever determination
was made on the subject would be most seriously weighed, and
taken on the best grounds. He then told me that a Cabinet
should be held to-day, to take the business into consideration.</p>

<p>To-day I dined with him, and saw both him and Townshend
after dinner. They both stated in the strongest manner the
inconvenience of so decisive a measure whilst a subject was in
agitation, and must be decided in a very few days, on which the
whole line and plan of your Government will have to depend.
For these reasons, they said it had been judged most proper to
postpone the Cabinet till something arrived from Paris. I
ended my conversation with Lord Shelburne by saying, that in
the event of war, I did not see how, after this delay, it would
be possible to resist; and that in that light it was my duty to
discharge my commission from you, and to state my own<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
sentiments as far as they could have any weight, that a few
days might do more mischief in Ireland than many years would
be able to repair. <i>Liberari animans meam.</i> To this he replied,
that I had done my part fairly, and that <i>he would be answerable
for the event</i>.</p>

<p>After all this detail, you will possibly wish to know my
sentiments upon the subject. From the whole of Lord Shelburne's
manner, I think that he is inclined to deal very fairly
by you, for his own sake. I have no doubt, from the style of
his conversation, that he is determined, in the present situation
of things, to stand the ground against concessions, and this both
from his own opinions and those of the King. But he certainly
either does not see, or affects not to see, the situation of Ireland
in that very alarming light in which it must be viewed by every
man acquainted with it.</p>

<p>As to the measure of the dissolution, I think you will agree
with him, that if we were sure of the favourable event, the
delay would not prove near so prejudicial on the one hand, as it
would be advantageous on the other. And from the language
he holds, I am persuaded, and Jemmy agrees with me in
opinion, that he is convinced that they will have their peace.
On the other hand, I cannot but say, that if the war continues,
we shall be in an awkward situation. The whole depends on
the greater or less probability of peace, to which we are neither
of us competent to decide; and I have thrown, if not the
disagreeable consequences, at least the responsibility of the
measure on him.</p>

<p>In this situation of things, I thought you would rather
choose that I should remain here to give you the very first
moment of news, and to press then a Cabinet upon the affairs
of Ireland in general, than that I should run back to you in
our present uncertainty. You will observe, that although I
have rather expressed myself to you satisfied with the affair, I
have taken infinite pains not to let it appear to them; but on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
the contrary, have left Lord Shelburne in no small uneasiness
about the manner in which you may take it; so that if you
should be dissatisfied, I have by no means pledged you. If
you think with me, the whole merit of it will lay at your
door.</p>

<p>I desired Townshend to state to the King that I was ready
to obey His Majesty's commands, if he wished to ask me any
questions. He told me to-day that the King expressed
himself perfectly ready to give me an audience <i>if I wished for
one</i>. This I thought was better declined. I shall go to the
lev&eacute;e on Friday, and shall be very impatient for your answer to
this long detail.</p>

<p>Whatever your opinion may be of the line of conduct which
I have held, I trust you will do justice to my zeal for your
interests and honour, inseparably connected as they are, and I
hope will ever remain, with my own, and to the sincere affection
with which I am,</p>

<p>Ever most truly yours,<br/>
W. W. G.</p></div>


<div class="blockquot"><p>MR. W. W. GRENVILLE TO LORD TEMPLE.</p>

<p>Pall Mall, Saturday, Nov. 30th, 1782.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Brother</span>,</p>

<p>I have just been with Townshend, who sent for me on the
subject of a despatch from you, relating to the proceedings in
the King's Bench here, on an Irish cause.</p>

<p>I have seen Troward, the attorney concerned in the cause,
and from him have learnt, what you probably know by this
time, that the case has been argued here, and the judgment of
the Court in Ireland affirmed; so that nothing can be done
in it here, especially as the Term has been over these two days.
It is impossible not to see the use which will be made in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
Ireland of this unlucky business. You say nothing in your
letter to Townshend of the Protest, nor have I heard a word on
that or any other subject from Ireland since I have been here.
But I much fear that the alarm among the Bar, upon a point
which affects their private interests as well as their national
pride, will have prevented, or in great measure impeded its
being signed. The only grounds that you can take, as far
at least as I can see, are those which I have desired Townshend
to insert in his answer. The Bill of Exceptions was certified
from an Irish Court. It has been depending eighteen months.
The objection to the jurisdiction was never started. The King's
Bench in Ireland either has been applied to or will be so next
Term, to grant a writ of possession on the affirmance of the
English Court. This will of course be denied them, and the
whole English proceeding treated as waste paper. No Judge
will allow&mdash;no sheriff will execute, any English process. No
man will again be so absurd as to subject himself to a considerable
expense to obtain a judgment of no more effect than
the decisions of a Prussian court-martial would be as to a
question of property here.</p>

<p>Still, however, I am far from being insensible to the clamour
which will be raised, and to the advantage which will be taken
of the opinion of the Court here, that their jurisdiction still
remains, notwithstanding the Irish Act to the contrary. Possibly
you may find it necessary to hold out some solution; and
perhaps you will think the opportunity is not a bad one to cut
the ground still more decisively from under Mr. Flood's feet
than even by the proposed resolutions. What I mean is, the
passing a bill here which should in the preamble declare the
repeal to have been a renunciation of the rights formerly exercised
by this kingdom over Ireland, and should enact that <i>therefore</i> for
the future, no writ of error, &amp;c., &amp;c., should be received,
signed or determined in any of the King's Courts of Justice in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
this country. If this idea should please you, it might be done
immediately, and you might settle the words with Yelverton or
Burgh.</p>

<p>If you think this too like a concession, you might hold out
the idea of an Act to be passed in Ireland, inflicting the penalties
of a <i>pr&aelig;munire</i> against any persons seeking justice out of the
kingdom; in imitation of the old statutes against ecclesiastics
applying to the papal authority.</p>

<p>Lord Shelburne threw out to me the other day, but when
I could not ask him any more upon the subject, the idea of a
paragraph about Ireland in the King's Speech. I have writ to
Townshend to-day, to desire that if this idea is pursued, he will
let me see it before the words are finally determined upon.
I think such a paragraph may have a good effect; because,
when re-echoed in the addresses, it will include the three
branches.</p>

<p>I am waiting with the most anxious expectation the decision
of the great question&mdash;peace or war? Reports are hourly
circulated on both sides, but nothing is known from any
authority. I need not say, that the moment it is known, I will
send it off.</p>

<p>I know no more of the East India business than you will see
in the papers. I was so intent on this, that I forgot to ask
Townshend to-day about it.</p>

<p>I shall most probably be with you before you can answer
this, as the 5th is the day for the meeting. But if they should
again prorogue the Parliament, and wish me to stay, supposing
the point not decided, what shall I do?</p>


<p>Ever most affectionately yours,<br/>
W. W. G.</p>


<p>Townshend and Conway have both been plaguing me about
Murray, who wanted to raise a corps in the North. It seems<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
he is an Irishman, with considerable connexions in the North.
Talbot's inspection makes a figure in the papers.</p></div>


<div class="blockquot"><p>MR. W. W. GRENVILLE TO LORD TEMPLE.</p>

<p>(Most Secret and Private.)</p>

<p>Pall Mall, Monday, Dec. 2nd, 1782.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Brother</span>,</p>

<p>I told you, in my last letter, that Lord Shelburne had thrown
out to me the idea of a paragraph in the King's Speech on the
subject of Ireland, and that I had applied to Townshend, that I
might see it before it was decided upon. In consequence of
this, I received, through him, a message from Lord Shelburne,
desiring to see me this morning. I have just been with him.
He made his excuses to me as soon as I came in, for having
appointed me at a time when he should only be able to converse
with me for <i>a very short time</i>, as unexpected business had
occurred. He then took out the Speech, and read to me the
sentence in question, which is nearly this: The liberal spirit of
your measures respecting the commerce of Ireland, confirmed
by the rest of your conduct towards her, meets with my full
approbation and concurrence; and I should recommend to you
a general revision of the trade laws of this kingdom on the
same extended principles. I own this did not strike me as
being sufficiently extensive. I mentioned the insertion of the
word rights&mdash;commerce and rights&mdash;but he did not at all seem
to give into it. He said that we were not ripe for that; that
the best thing that could be done was that we should adhere
exactly to the settlement; that it was a bond from which we
ought in no instance to depart; and that a steady Government
would enable us to stand to it in Ireland as well as here.
Above all, he said he looked to the effects of a full confidence
between you and himself, which union and concurrence would be
more important for Government than any other point whatever&mdash;that
it gave more strength than even abilities or weight. With<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
this I closed in, seeing it in vain to push the other, and told
him that the appearance of confidence and support here would,
I was convinced, assist you more than even the adoption of any
specific measure; that in the case of a peace, I did not doubt
that you would be sufficiently strong to carry on your Government
with ease, but that I could not answer for the event of a
continuance of the war. He answered, that the situation of
Ireland weighed very materially with him in his wishes for
peace, and that, although he never wished to shift off
responsibility, yet he trusted in your integrity and honour;
that, if he found it necessary, he should be enabled to state
that part of the subject from the best authority. To this I
thought myself justified in answering, that most certainly you
would never abandon a ground which you had already stated to
him, and which every hour made clearer to you; and that such
a consideration certainly ought to weigh with Government
in making the peace.</p>

<p>He then went on to say, that he had in general no doubt but
that you would find your Government easy and prosperous; he
enumerated the advantages with which you will meet the Parliament
<i>in October</i>&mdash;a settled ministry here, things arranged
in Ireland, the Parliament fully canvassed, and possibly a
peace. I said, that when I saw him before, I had stated the
possibility of your being driven to meet the Parliament in the
spring; that I had stated it as a possible evil; and that I
wished to explain to him that the necessity of this would by no
means be affected either way by the difference between an
immediate dissolution, and that which must take place before
the March assizes. To this he by no means agreed; as a
dissolution late in February would, he said, by the time the
elections were over, bring us far on towards the summer
months. He then reverted to his opinion as to the probability
of your having a smooth and easy Government. It was his
idea he said, that real commotion never was produced but by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
real grievances. My answer was, that the people of Ireland
did suffer real misery, which, as was frequently the case, they
would impute to Government, however little founded such an
idea would be. This, he said, would lead us at length into a
disquisition on the state of Ireland, on which subject he
intended, before I went, to have a long conversation with me,
but that he was now too much pressed.</p>

<p>After this, I thought I could not, with any propriety, prolong
my visit. Since I wrote the above, I have seen Townshend.
He agrees perfectly in opinion with me, that the mention of
the commerce, with so very general a reference to the constitutional
part of the question, could produce no good effect in
Ireland, and might be made an invidious use of. He threw out
the idea of omitting the paragraph entirely; and most certainly,
if Lord Shelburne sees, or thinks he sees, any objection
to being more explicit on the subject, I know no necessity
whatever for saying a word about it. It certainly will produce
debate on the affairs of Ireland, which is much to be avoided;
and in the form in which it now stands, or indeed in any into
which it could be thrown, so as to form part of the King's
Speech, it would be of no advantage to us in Ireland, whilst it
would afford ground of cavil and objection to our enemies. In
this idea, I have written to Lord Shelburne, to desire to see
him again; but as he may possibly appoint me for to-morrow,
and you must be impatient to hear from England, I shall not
detain the messenger.</p>

<p>With respect to that cursed cause, I hardly know what to
say: it must have set you very much afloat, particularly with
the lawyers who are interested in the question. In my last
letter, I threw out the idea of a bill in this country to prevent
the receiving or hearing Irish causes in the English courts. I
have shown to Townshend the draught of such a bill, which I
enclose to you with this letter. I believe his disposition is
most real and unaffected, to leave the management of the whole<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
Irish business to you, and to support you honestly and fairly in
whatever measures you adopt. But it is not difficult to see
that the whole administration and business of Government <i>roule
sur bien un autre pivot</i>. As far as one can separate Lord Shelburne's
intentions from his verbiage and professions, I think I
see a strong disposition to resist the least tendency towards
any further concession, or even to the appearance of it. On
the contrary, if any very good opportunity should offer itself, I
should think him more inclined to lessen than to extend. He
either has, or affects, an opinion very different from that which
I hold out to him with respect to the difficulties of your Government,
and exclaims even against the possibility of your being
driven from your ground. I can't say that I think this situation
between your official Minister and the real Premier quite
pleasant, because it seems to me that the despatches of the one,
however explicit, being all written without the concurrence
of the Cabinet, do not pledge the opinions of the other, which
are, after all, the only opinions which are of any consequence.</p>

<p>I believe I stated to you in my last the reason which Townshend
gave to me, and which Lord Shelburne assigned to
Jemmy, for not calling a Cabinet immediately on my arrival,
namely, their unwillingness to meet them before they had news
from Paris, because they had been hitherto unanimous, and
hoped to meet Parliament so; and if they were called upon the
subject of Ireland, nobody knows what other hare might be
started there, however they might agree upon Irish affairs.
You will certainly think the mode of keeping a Cabinet
unanimous, by never meeting them at all, an excellent one;
however, in the situation of things here, I did not think it
would be decent in me to distress Government, especially as
I really think the propriety of the dissolution at this moment
depends much on the event of the business at Paris. I have
therefore contented myself with an explicit assurance from
Townshend, that when news of that arrives, which is now most<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
anxiously expected every hour, a Cabinet shall be held, to go
into the whole line of Irish business.</p>

<p>Townshend showed me his despatches on the subject of the
embargo, and of this Irish cause, both of which the King has
seen, but I believe, no one else. The idea of the resolutions
not being proposed till your wish was known, was suggested
to him by me, because, if you should be driven&mdash;and things
certainly verge towards it&mdash;to any further concession, you will
not be much assisted by those two resolutions standing on the
journals in array against you. But I believe the attention of
every one here will be so much employed by the great point of
peace or war, that there will be very little room for Irish
politics, either in the House of Commons or the House of
Lords.</p>

<p>I asked Townshend, an hour ago, whether there was anything
from Paris; and he told me explicitly that they knew nothing
at all, but was in most anxious expectation. The Parliament
certainly meets on Thursday. I think, from the style of their
language, and particularly from Lord Shelburne's trying to
make me pledge you to it, that they are confident of a peace;
and certainly, if they have it not, their situation is very precarious,
to say no more of it. If they do meet Parliament with
a peace, I am persuaded they will stand their ground. The
country gentlemen hold in general rather a friendly language
than otherwise. I shall certainly now stay over Thursday;
but after that, get back to you as soon as I can.</p>

<p>Lord Mahon has been with me, and is outrageous about
the Duke of Leinster. He wanted me to engage that Government
would give them land if the other offers failed; but I
begged to decline.</p>

<p>I have received the enclosed from Talbot, and have also sent
you my answer, which you will forward or not, as you think
right.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span></p>

<p>Lord Nugent is out of all patience with you for not answering
his letter. Adieu.</p>

<p>Believe me,<br/>
Ever most affectionately yours,<br/>
W. W. G.</p>

<p>I have not given you the words of the Speech exactly, but
nearly. Yorke and Banks move in the House of Commons;
Lord Carmarthen and &mdash;&mdash; in the House of Lords.</p>

<p>You will probably think it right to write to Lord Shelburne,
stating the difficulties of your situation at full length; because
I think his idea of ease and smoothness ought by no means to
remain uncontradicted. If you do that, I should think it
would not be amiss to say something about a peace, for he
evidently meant that I should have pledged you to that, and to
acknowledge his professions, which have been boundless and
unlimited.</p>

<p>I should think it would be also an act of real justice to
Townshend to say something to him about his conduct towards
you, which I think as honourable and friendly as possible. If

<div class="blockquot"><p>MR. W. W. GRENVILLE TO LORD TEMPLE.</p>

<p>Pall Mall, Dec. 5th, Eleven at Night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Brother</span>,</p>

<p>In consequence of their having altered their minds about
Ireland, I was summoned to give my opinion. I think the
words as they stand now are sufficiently strong, and they
passed to-night without the least animadversion: "The liberal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
principles adopted by you with respect to the rights and commerce
of Ireland, do you the highest honour, and must, I
trust, ensure that harmony which ought ever to subsist
between the two kingdoms."</p>

<p>We have had no division to-night. The speakers, Lord N.,
Fox, Burke, Townshend and Pitt.</p>

<p>Lord N. uncommonly well, holding off from both sides. Fox
and Pitt both worse than usual. The chief debate about peace.
The giving up Gibraltar was thrown out by Banks, and strongly
objected to by Lord N., Burke, and Fox.</p>

<p>Johnstone made an attack upon Lord Howe, which was as ill
received as it deserved to be. I would have sent you a
copy of the King's Speech, but it is so uncommonly long, that
it is not out yet. It is utterly impossible to travel through the
great variety of matter which it comprehends. Remarkably
full house.</p>

<p>Bulkeley was in the House of Lords; says that Shelburne
acquitted himself very well. Lord Stormont attacked him
about the Independence. He defended it as the wish of
the people. Lord Fitzgerald spoke but badly. No division
there.</p>

<p>Ever yours,<br/>
W. W. G.</p>

<p>Keith Stewart answered Johnstone, defending Lord Howe
very warmly. Everybody who spoke after Johnstone reprobated
him. Duke of Richmond attacked Lord Sandwich.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>MR. W. W. GRENVILLE TO LORD TEMPLE.</p>

<p>Pall Mall, Saturday, Dec. 7th, 1782.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Brother</span>,</p>

<p>I received your packet late on Thursday night, or rather, I
believe, early on Friday morning. As soon as I was up I sent
the enclosed letter to Lord Shelburne and to Townshend. I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
received from Lord Shelburne an answer appointing me in an
hour's time.</p>

<p>When I went there, after waiting a considerable time (which
I can easily excuse when I reflect upon the business of this
moment), I was shown into a room, where he was with Townshend.
It is difficult for me to say whether I was more surprised
or mortified at his telling me, as soon as I came in, that he could
only see me for a minute or two. He then entered upon the
subject of your letter, by saying that he had not read Mr.
Townshend's despatches, but only your letter to himself and
the bill which you enclosed to Townshend. With respect to
the bill, he said nothing could be done without consulting the
Chancellor and the other lawyers of the Cabinet; that I must
see the Chancellor, and explain the business to him; that the
rendering a judgment null might be objected to. I answered
that I was persuaded <i>that</i> was the part on which you was least
bent, and that you would be fully satisfied if the enacting
clause went only to prevent any future decisions, provided the
preamble expressed the principle. To this he said, that it was
impossible to go on if everything of this sort made a necessity
for new measures, and that when a ground was once taken, it
ought to be stood to. My answer was, that your ground was
very materially changed, and that this overturned the only
reasoning upon which you had been able to go on at all,
namely, the pledging your own personal faith, and the honour
of Government here, that the repeal of the G. I. was considered
as a renunciation on the part of Great Britain of all legislation
and jurisdiction. He asked whether I meant external as well
as internal? I said, undoubtedly. He said, that he had
understood from your conversation before you went, "that you
meant to make your stand upon the external legislation;" and
for this he appealed to Townshend, who said he had understood
the same. It was impossible for me to contradict this, as it
referred to conversations to which I was no party. He said<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
that he thought you was reasonable upon the subject of the
dissolution, and that this other business was not to be taken up
suddenly. I asked what then he wished me to do. He told
me to wait upon the Chancellor. I objected that the question
was not a legal one, but wholly political. I urged the consequences
of delay. Still, however, I could get no answer from
him, but only that I must go to the Chancellor; and at last he
grew so impatient as to leave the room while I was talking, and
to tell Townshend that he might find him in his (Lord Shelburne's)
office. The whole conversation did not last above
four or five minutes at the utmost. I turned to Townshend,
and asked him if he thought it possible that the Government of
Ireland could go on in this manner. He pressed me to go to
the Chancellor, and said that he could tell me, <i>en ami</i>, that I
should do more good there in three minutes than I could do
elsewhere in as many hours.</p>

<p>By the way, I must say here, that by some inaccuracy I
must have explained myself very ill to you about Townshend,
who seems to me to have acted the most friendly and honest
part towards you in the course of the whole business, and who
has sacrificed his time to me for an hour or an hour and a half
for several days; while during the fortnight I have now been
here, I have not seen Lord Shelburne for twenty minutes in
the whole.</p>

<p>I have been very particular in detailing the above conversation
to you, because I think it opens two things of infinite
importance to your personal comfort and your personal honour.
I think it extremely plain that the object of Lord Shelburne is
to gain time, and that let me press ever so eagerly, <i>which I
shall not fail to do</i>, still I am not to expect any final answer till
the negotiation is settled, and the peace, which they evidently
look upon as certain, is secured and announced. What effect
these delays may have in Ireland, and what appearance this
state of uncertainty must bear to those who know the proposal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
you have made, you are best able to judge, but I know enough
of it to be very much alarmed. But the second consideration
affects me much more, as I think it affects your honour, and my
own as involved with it. What I mean is this: I threw out to you
in my former letters that Lord Shelburne appears to me much
more disposed to narrow than to extend the rights and concessions
yielded to Ireland by Great Britain. I think when you
compare the evident reluctance he showed to agree to the resolutions
first proposed; his telling me that he had thought of a
paragraph in the King's Speech to do instead of them; his
then showing me a paragraph relating merely to commercial
advantages, and his telling me we were not ripe for the word
rights; when you compare all this with his evident dislike to
this bill, and with the expression stated above about external
legislation, it is not very difficult to collect that he means to do
nothing till we have peace, and when we have, he means, to use
his own expression, to make the stand upon that point.</p>

<p>Possibly I may agree with him, that it might have been well
for the general interest of the empire if that ground had
originally been explained, decisively taken and maintained.
But I am sure I know too well the situation of that country
and of this, to think that it can now be held out without the
most fatal consequences to both; and I think I know your
feelings too well to imagine that you will suffer yourself to be
made an instrument of deceiving any man or body of men
whatever, still less a whole country, especially in contradiction
to the language which you have invariably held, at least as far
as I can recollect (ever since you accepted of your situation),
both to people in Ireland and to Government here, that the
repeal was a complete renunciation.</p>

<p>It is a singular pleasure to me to observe how exactly our
ideas have hitherto corresponded since I left you; so that while
you have been taking your measures in Ireland, I have been
recommending the same to you from hence. If they should<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
continue to do so in this instance, the line of conduct which I
apprehend would be proper for us to adopt on our different
posts is this. I am to see the Chancellor to-morrow, and immediately
upon leaving him mean to write to Lord Shelburne,
pressing him again most eagerly to allow me an opportunity of
stating to him <i>at length</i> what I have in commission to say to him
from you. If he should comply, I will then go into the whole
state of Ireland; will mention to him the credit which ought to
be given to representations proceeding from you, in preference
to those of interested individuals; will enlarge upon the necessity
of decision; and will press that a Cabinet may be held in
performance of Townshend's promise to me. In the meantime,
I should think you would do well to write a letter to Townshend,
stating your ideas upon the necessity of good faith, and
the impossibility of resistance, even upon the ground of simple
repeal, still more upon the more narrow one of external legislation;
and desiring an explicit answer <i>from the Cabinet</i> on these
points. This, if you would entrust me with it, I would
suppress in case the Cabinet should have met and come
to any satisfactory decision; and if not, I would deliver it
to Townshend, with every personal expression to him of regard,
&amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

<p>The advantages which I propose by this conduct, and the
mode of reasoning upon which I support it, are as follows: In
the first place, if it is really their intention to reserve the
external legislation, the sooner you know it, and are able to
wash your hands of it completely, by returning to England,
the more popular you will be in Ireland, and the better ground
you will have here, both to your own conscience, and as a man
who may be called upon to defend his conduct. You will
observe that I take it for granted you agree with me as to the
utter impossibility of ever exercising such a right, and the
impolicy as well as bad faith of reserving it, to become, like the
tea-duty, a ground for contest and ill-blood; without the possibility<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
of advantage. Lord Shelburne seems to imagine that by
a peace he should be able to enforce it; you know the contrary,
and that the hearts and voices, and even hands, not of the
Volunteers only, but of the people, and even of Parliament,
would be against it. And with what face, supposing the thing
in itself practicable and honest, could we maintain that ground,
after having repeatedly stated the contrary, and pledged ourselves
to it in resolutions, and now in a bill offered under your
recommendation for the English Parliament? In this event,
therefore, I think that by an immediate resignation you will
have satisfied your own feelings, and at the same time found
an honourable solution to a very unpleasant situation&mdash;unpleasant
from the situation of things there, and possibly not less so
from the complexion of affairs here.</p>

<p>If, on the other hand, this measure drives them into an
immediate acquiescence with your proposals, you will certainly
stand in a much pleasanter situation in Ireland, especially as a
peace will give you a fair ground for dissolving the Fencibles,
if you think proper, without ever coming to Parliament to vote
money for them. The advantages which we shall have from
putting an end to this almost intolerable scene of delay and temporizing
are obvious; and if the measure comes from Townshend,
and is seconded by me, as I shall propose, it will give you all
the credit of the adherence to good faith, &amp;c., &amp;c., instead of its
being forced upon Government, as it will otherwise be, by
Lord Beauchamp, or Commodore Johnstone, or any person
disposed to do mischief.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>MR. W. W. GRENVILLE TO LORD TEMPLE.</p>

<p>Pall Mall, Sunday, Dec. 15th, 1782.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Brother</span>,</p>

<p>I am just returned from Lord Shelburne's. He appointed
me yesterday to be with him this morning, and I have had a
pretty long conversation with him on the subject of Ireland.
But it was for the most part so very general, that it is not easy
to reduce it to writing.</p>

<p>I began by stating under two distinct heads the original
object of my being sent here, and what had since happened.
First, that I had been commissioned to explain the grounds on
which you had wished to stand against further concessions,
your reasons for imagining it doubtful whether that ground
could be maintained, and your certain conviction that it could
be done only by an immediate dissolution of Parliament. The
second point I said was, that, by what had since happened, you
apprehended that something further was made necessary, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
this was the more evident from the manner in which every one
had taken up the business in Ireland.</p>

<p>These two points, of course, led us into a very wide field of
conversation. As to the dissolution, I said you certainly would
not press the Ministry for any more on the subject, than that,
even with a peace, and a remedy to the business of the King's
Bench, it should not be delayed beyond the end of January.
The great object, he said, was at all events not to meet till
October. My answer was, that to you, who were personally to
meet the difficulties of an earlier meeting, they certainly would
appear quite as strong as they could to him sitting at a distance
and speculating upon them. It was therefore by no
means a thing to be wished by you, but an evil which circumstances
might render necessary. This led me to a mention of
several causes of discontent which might arise or be sought for,
and which could only be prevented by the Irish Parliament;
such as an infringement, for instance, of the East India
monopoly. We went, at different periods of the conversation,
a good deal into this business. He threw out an idea, which
he said had been often mentioned, and for which a foundation
was certainly laid in the last resolution of the English Houses
on Irish affairs, if we chose to pursue it. This was the fixing,
by a sort of treaty, a commercial system between the two countries,
and a proportionable contribution to be paid by Ireland
for the general protection of the empire.</p>

<p>When I mentioned the objection to this, founded on the
impossibility that Ireland could in her present situation contribute
such a quota as would hereafter be even infinitely too
small for her share, he answered it by stating the possibility of
having a tax on some particular article or description of articles
applicable to this purpose, which might be so fixed as to be
small at present, very small if necessary, but which might
increase with the wealth and commerce of Ireland. On this
idea of a settlement, our conversation dwelt a good deal. I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
expressed my opinion that it would be, in many points of view,
a measure of dignity and weight, and particularly advantageous
to both countries, as it would leave no ground of contest
unexplained. But at the same time I thought the present
moment unfavourable for such a step, because it ought not to
be taken till Government in Ireland recovered its energy;
otherwise, I stated that the wildest idea that could be broached
in a newspaper would be adopted by those in whom the real
Government of the country resides at the present moment;
that, till the Volunteers have in some degree subsided, your
Government could only subsist by expedients, painful as such
an idea must be to your feelings. I stated also, that if this
was to be held out to the country as the satisfaction and
security to which they were to look, it would set all their heads
afloat forming systems of trade and government; and that it
would make the spring meeting absolutely necessary, from the
impatience it would excite and the necessity of its being done
by Parliament.</p>

<p>From this we went into the present situation of your Government.
Upon this he desired to explain himself, and that I would
state to you that he was <i>inclined to think</i>, not that he <i>thought</i>,
your Government would go on more easily there than you expected.
He alluded to De Retz's maxim: "<i>Le peuple ne se soul&egrave;ve
jamais que quand on l'opprime</i>." To the truth of this I agreed
perfectly, but said that the people there are really oppressed,
and miserable to a degree I had not at all conceived till I went
into the country. That nothing was more usual than for the
people to mistake the cause of grievances which they really feel,
and that this I apprehended to be the case there. In that case,
he said, the remedy was at hand; for that an extended commerce
and the wisdom of internal regulations, would relieve the
evil, and be a pleasant task to your Government. I answered
that such remedies must be gradual, while the situation of
Ireland was pressing at this moment; and that perhaps<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
nothing had contributed more to the discontents now prevalent,
than the foolish expectations of wealth to be poured like a
torrent into the country by a free trade. To this he agreed,
but said that laws might certainly be devised by which such
remedies might be brought forward and hastened. Then he
went into the nature of absentee laws. Direct absentee taxes
were, he said, highly objectionable, but many things might be
thought of which would produce the effect so reasonably to be
wished, that the money arising from land in Ireland should not
be spent elsewhere. All methods to raise the value of that land
would operate to that effect; because, when the person residing
in England saw the means of getting an equivalent, he would
certainly prefer an estate at his own door to one in Ireland.
Still, however, this would be gradual.</p>

<p>With respect to the Volunteer force, he apprehended less
embarrassment from them, because he could not believe that
five thousand of them would ever bring themselves to march
ten miles together. I said, perhaps not, but that they had
each the means of resisting the execution of any law they
disliked in their own places of residence; whilst your whole
army did not amount, without the Provincials, to six thousand
men. And in time of peace, the Provincials were to be disbanded,
and only twelve thousand men could be brought back
upon the establishment. He asked whether the Provincials could
not be made permanent. I said, I apprehended not, and that
possibly the attempt would not be wise; for that, although you
had, by the most determined perseverance and by an unremitted
firmness, carried the point with respect to their being raised,
yet I thought that would be sufficient to show the steadiness
of Government, without seeking unnecessary grounds of discontent.</p>

<p>There were many other general heads of Irish Government
touched upon in the course of the conversation, which I do not
now remember. He spoke to the reports about the situation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
of English Government. I never heard any man, in the whole
course of my life, affirm any one thing more distinctly, positively,
and unequivocally, than he did, when he told me that
Government were upon a sure foundation here. He said that
I was too wise to expect him to explain to me upon what
grounds he said this, but that it was upon sure grounds;
that there was a moral certainty, and as a rational man he
proceeded upon it. This language is the more extraordinary,
because the opinion of the world in general, I might say of
almost every man in London, is directly the reverse. Either,
therefore, Lord Shelburne is (not a dissembler, but) the most
abandoned and direct liar upon the face of the earth, or he is
deceived himself, too grossly to be imagined, or the whole
world besides is deceived. Which of these is the case, time
will show, and that only; but I cannot bring myself to imagine
that the first is. That he wishes you should believe him
secure, I can easily imagine, and that he wishes it very
strongly; but that he should therefore be induced to pledge
himself to so direct a falsehood, which he must know it was my
business to repeat to you, and yours to act upon, and which
the event of a few weeks must demonstrate to be false if it is
so, exceeds my utmost power of belief. That the Duke of
Richmond thinks as Lord Shelburne has expressed himself
to me, is, I apprehend, most probable, from the very strong
compliments he paid him and the flattering language he held
to him in the House of Lords on Friday. But this is mere
conjecture. What is certain, on the other hand, is that the
explanation given by him in the House of Lords of the
American treaty does not tally with that of Pitt, Townshend
and Conway in the House of Commons, to which nevertheless
the three last have positively pledged their faith and honour,
that the Cabinet has been postponed because Lord Shelburne
was afraid to meet them, and that the report of the day is that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
Lord Shelburne was outvoted there upon the question of
Gibraltar.</p>

<p>After we had gone over a great deal of conversation on these
subjects for above an hour and a half, he said that we seemed
to agree about all the points on which we had touched. I then
mentioned the two main objects&mdash;the Dissolution, and the Bill
of Satisfaction. To the dissolution, he said he imagined no
difficulty would be made to-day in the Cabinet which was to be
held; as to the other point, he saw much more objection. It
cut up the principle on which our stand had been made. People
were not ripe in England to go into the whole question again.
The moment a bill of that sort was proposed in the House of
Commons, every man would have to give his opinion on the
effect of the repeal, on the legal question, and on the right of
internal and external legislation. There never was a debate on
Irish questions in England that was not misrepresented; and
this, together with the acknowledgment of the principle of the
insufficiency of what was done last year, would put Mr. Flood
on excellent ground. To many of these objections I could not
but subscribe, for they strike me very strongly. I wished to
know from him his idea on the external legislation. He said
he had understood you, when you left England, that you was
determined never to cede that. I said, that as his Lordship
referred to conversations to which I was no party, I could only
say that I had understood you very differently. The distinction
between external and internal, he said, was a bad one, as
applied to Ireland. It was applied by Fox, who took it from
Lord Chatham, by whom it had been adopted, for want of a
better expression, in the case of America. I said, the distinction
I made was a clear one&mdash;that England could, in her own
ports, restrain as she pleased the commerce of Ireland; but
that it was not in the power of Government, after what had
been done (whether wisely or not), to enforce any English Act<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
which was to be executed in Ireland. He said, that this
brought us back to the idea of a settlement; and that he
should be curious, and indeed it was necessary to the subject,
to know what questions about English Acts concerning trade,
and what other commercial points would come into discussion
in such a settlement. At the same time, he said, the subject
was one of those which required conversing with people of
information, and which, nevertheless, if any one was consulted
upon it, would set the heads of every one afloat. However, he
wished I would turn my thoughts to it, and let him see the
principal points. I then pressed him again upon the head
of your Bill; I thought it right to say that I was satisfied on
every other head, but that this pressed strongly on my mind.
All I wished was, that he would allow me to state to you the
difficulties, such as he had mentioned them; but at the same
time, to say, that they were overbalanced by an absolute
necessity. He said, that he would not suppose that they could
be overbalanced.</p>

<p>While I write this, I receive your despatches of the 12th
instant. I have immediately enclosed your letter to Townshend,
with one from myself, of which I send you a copy, and wait his
answer with impatience. I was going on, when I was interrupted
by your letters, to state to you, that my conversation
with Lord Shelburne closed with his saying that the difficulties
were capital, and that he could not believe that they could be
overbalanced. I then observed, that a Cabinet was, I understood,
to be held to-day. He said yes, and at eleven, and that
it was then half-past ten, and therefore I must excuse him.
As I had been there above an hour and a half, I could not with
any propriety stay any longer.</p>

<p>According to Townshend's directions to me last night, I staid
at home the whole morning, under the idea that I was to be sent
for, as it was so directed in the King's approbation for the Cabinet
being held, which Townshend showed me. Why this was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
not done, whether the Cabinet has not been held, or whether Lord
Shelburne thought he had received information enough for all, I
cannot pretend to say. It is certainly unnecessary for me to
observe, that the whole of this magnificent idea about a settlement
was most probably intended to draw your attention off
from the Bill you have proposed. I could do no otherwise than
acquiesce in sending it over to you, as I had already stated my
belief, confirmed so fully by your authority, that your proposal
was necessary, and to the adoption of it, on this ground, I
meant, if I could, to have pledged him by my last question;
and although he did not accede to what I then asked, yet
I think I should not have been justified in not agreeing to state
to you his objections&mdash;which certainly have their weight, especially
as he proposed an expedient in the room of yours, though
insufficient and improper for the reasons which, as I told you
above, I mentioned to him. I forgot to state in its proper place
that I reminded him of the danger which was almost inevitable,
that some enemy to Government would take the business up, if
not immediately done by Ministry themselves.</p>

<p>Half-past Eleven, <span class="smcap">P.M.</span></p>

<p>I have just received the enclosed answer from Townshend;
and though it contains nothing, yet I cannot but feel too much
for your impatience to delay till Wednesday night the acknowledging
your despatches, and the assuring you that there shall
be no remissness whatever on my part to follow up this business
as much as possible, and to press it forward in this strange
scene of procrastination. Nothing can make me happier than
your approbation of my conduct, and your kind disposition to
trust so much to that most unfeigned affection with which I am,</p>

<p>My dearest brother,<br/>
Ever yours,<br/>
W. W. <span class="smcap">Grenville</span>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span></p>

<p>P.S.&mdash;I mean to-morrow to write to Lord Shelburne, stating
that you have sent over a fresh despatch to Mr. Townshend,
and referring him to that for the absolute necessity of adopting
your proposal, which still leaves room for his settlement, if it is
thought proper and expedient. The one will remove the
present difficulty, the other prevent the rise of any fresh source
of discord. But how far the latter can or ought at this time to
be taken up, is with me very doubtful. If I get on Wednesday
such an answer as I wish, you shall see me very soon.</p></div>


<div class="blockquot"><p>MR. W. W. GRENVILLE TO LORD TEMPLE.</p>

<p>Pall Mall, Dec. 20th, 1782.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Brother</span>,</p>


<p>I am still unable to send you any final answer, although I
must confess that I think we approach much nearer to it than
we have done yet.</p>

<p>The Cabinet met yesterday. As I was not quite satisfied
with what I had said the day before on the subject of recognition,
and of the preamble, I thought it better to put a few
words to paper, and to send them to Townshend. I enclose a
copy of that paper and the letter which went with it. They
were delivered to Townshend during the Cabinet. I heard
nothing at all from him last night.</p>

<p>This morning I was surprised and shocked&mdash;and I cannot
say which I was most&mdash;by seeing in the papers the conversation
which had passed in the House on the subject of Ireland, of which
Fitzpatrick, though it was evidently a concerted thing, had not
thought proper to give me any notice whatever. I immediately
resolved to say something about it in the House to-day.
Accordingly I sent a note to Townshend, desiring to be allowed
to wait upon him in the morning. I told him my intention,
and questioned him upon the subject of the Cabinet. He
showed me, what (he said) was not properly a minute, but a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
memorandum taken there. I could not copy that, but as soon
as I came home I endeavoured to recollect it, and believe the
enclosed is very near the words. This I said immediately was
only losing time, and that it was very useless for him to trouble
himself with writing such a despatch, as I would take upon
myself to make your answer to the two points it contained:
First, that the bill you had sent over was drawn expressly to
avoid the question of what <i>had been</i> the right, as it declared
only what <i>is</i> now the right; and that if there was to be any
reservation as to its being now the right, I would only say that
this would be the most disgraced country in Europe. As to
the other point, I knew perfectly that every step you had taken
was with a full knowledge of the circumstances of the case,
because I had sent them over to you myself a few days after
my arrival in London. That being the case, Townshend said
he would not write, but state these things to the Cabinet,
which was to meet again either to-morrow or the next day; I
do not positively remember which. I then stated to him what
I meant to say to-day, in which he acquiesced. He told me
General Conway wished to see me, as he thought that he had
struck out an idea which might answer effectually; and he
showed me a few words which were to explain this idea. They
were in the form of a resolution, and went only to say, that
Great Britain had, by the repeal, renounced all thoughts of
exercising any right to make laws to bind Ireland. You may
easily guess the answer which I made to this.</p>

<p>From Townshend I went to Conway. Him I found very
strongly impressed with Lord B.'s ideas about renunciation,
complete satisfaction, and the effect of a declaratory law, and of
the repeal of it, which, he said, left things as they were before.
I combated all this very strongly, and at last got him to acquiesce
in the idea of a recognition, provided that the words were
such as not to imply that England <i>never had</i> the right. I said
that I conceived, as this was merely a point of honour, and not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
a reservation of anything to be exercised in future, that all that
Government could desire was to use such words as should not
<i>necessarily</i> imply that the right never existed; that this was
expressly the description of the words in your bill, which were
so drawn as to go only to present right, and yet so as to be
very satisfactory to Ireland. In all this he acquiesced, and
then wished that some notice might be given in the "Dublin
Gazette;" that the cause had only been heard because it was
pending before; and that after the holidays, something satisfactory
would be done. I answered as to the first, that after
the opinion delivered privately by the Chancellor, and in the
House of Commons, as I had understood, by the Attorney-General,
that even a new cause could not be rejected by the
Judges, such a ground would be a very bad one to take. To
this he agreed. As to the other point, I said that it was my
intention to state it in the House of Commons, which I apprehended
would answer nearly the same purpose. He assented
to this also, and so I left him. I then went to the House of
Commons; there I saw Townshend, and asked him what day
the Parliament was to meet after Christmas, because I thought
it would give more solemnity if I gave notice for a particular
day, and moved for a call on that day; and that the earlier it
was, the better it would be. He said they met on the 21st. I
proposed that day, and he agreed. Hartley rose at the same
time with me, and being called to, moved for a call on the
22nd. I then got up and said, that if I had not been prevented,
I was going to have moved it for the 21st; but I would
now trouble the House only to give notice that on that day a
very important business would be brought before them on the
subject of Ireland; that I had understood that a conversation
had taken place the day before on that subject; that I lamented
exceedingly that I had been so unfortunate as to be absent at
that time, because if I had been there I should have thought it
my duty to have stated to the House, in justice to the Lord-Lieutenant<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
of Ireland, that the business in question had been
submitted by you to the consideration of Government, and had
been in the contemplation of the King's servants a considerable
time before any notice had been given of a motion to be made
upon it by a noble Lord in the House; that I wished further,
in justice to you, to say, that "there was no man in either
kingdom more decidedly of opinion that the good faith of Great
Britain was solemnly pledged to Ireland, by the repeal of the
6th Geo. I., in the last sessions, upon the avowed and explained
principle of putting an end to every idea of legislation and
jurisdiction over that kingdom; and that there was no man
more eagerly desirous than you, that that faith so pledged, and
upon that principle so explained, should be religiously adhered
to and maintained, as the national honour and national interest
required it should be maintained, sacred and inviolable."</p>

<p>This brought up Lord Beauchamp, who began by assuring
and protesting that the part he had taken was upon the best
motives, &amp;c., &amp;c. He then went into the question of the writ
of error, how far it could have been rejected, and how useless it
was in Ireland, &amp;c., &amp;c. He then said that it was a point of
parliamentary fairness, that when one person had given notice
of a motion, it should be left to him, and not taken up in the
meantime by any other person.</p>

<p>I answered, that as to the noble Lord's motives, he must do
me the justice to say that <i>I</i> had been perfectly silent on that
head. That with respect to the question about the writ of
error, neither did I conceive this to be a proper time for that
discussion. But that with regard to parliamentary fairness, I
did not imagine that His Majesty's Government would think
themselves justified in postponing so important a question, and
which would have been brought on before the recess if there
had been time, merely because the noble Lord meant to move
something about it at a distant day.</p>

<p>This ended the conversation on the subject; except that I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
added that the noble Lord had misunderstood me when
he imagined that <i>I</i> was to move the business on the 21st,
as I <i>apprehended</i> that it was the intention of Government
to do it.</p>

<p>I cannot help thinking that by this, which has been done
entirely without the concurrence or even knowledge of Lord
Shelburne, we have gained a great point. By giving such a
notice, speaking from the Treasury bench in the hearing of, and
backed by Townshend and Pitt, I have most undoubtedly
pledged Government to do something on that day. If that is
short of your wishes, see in what a situation they stand; if not,
you are landed. In the meantime the notice and the explicit
declaration made in your name must surely be infinitely useful
to you in Ireland.</p>

<p>I wait with great impatience the final decision of the Cabinet.
Conway's expression was, that he conceived there was no objection
to any preamble which had not a retrospect. If we can
convince them that ours has none, or frame one not quite so
strong, but very near it, think what ground we stand upon, in
having obtained something stronger and more advantageous to
the interests of Ireland than any renunciation whatever. "For
this we must thank" Mansfield, who has certainly extricated us
from a scene of considerable difficulty.</p>

<p>If it could be done without great inconvenience to you in
Ireland, I should be very desirous either of coming back here,
in case I get away soon enough, or if not, of staying here till
the 21st; because I am convinced my presence here is of
infinite moment, to prevent their being frightened at the time
into any weakening of the preamble, and to goad them on to do
something. For you see, even in this case, the objection was
not so much to the taking any particular step, as to the doing
anything at all; and when forced to that, and driven from their
intrenchments of indolence and delay, you see how much they
are inclined to take the measures you wish. But this shall be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
decided by your wishes on the subject, unless I should set out
before I receive them.</p>

<p>I say nothing of the dissolution; I have not, however, lost
sight of that, and will press it to-morrow; but I thought the
other the more important point, having so fine an opening, which
I trust you will think I have not neglected.</p>

<p>D'Ivernois is come. He was with me this morning, and
comes again to-morrow. He says the business goes on at
Geneva far better than he could have expected, owing to the
Constitution which the mediating powers have given them,
which appears truly, what he states it, worse than that of
Venice.</p>

<p>Believe me, my dear brother,<br/>
Ever most affectionately yours,<br/>

<div class="blockquot"><p>MR. W. W. GRENVILLE TO LORD TEMPLE.</p>

<p>Pall Mall, Dec. 23rd, 1782.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Brother</span>,</p>

<p>When I wrote last to you, I expressed considerable hopes
that this tedious business was drawing near to a conclusion, and
that Government here would at last consent to grant the happiness
and peace of Great Britain and Ireland, to solicitations
that I should have been ashamed to have employed for any
private object, however near to me. These hopes are, I must
confess, weakened by my conversation of this morning with
Townshend. I can plainly see that he is himself personally
disposed to comply with your wishes. I can as plainly see
that a greater and more powerful minister sets himself against
them.</p>

<p>Dec. 24th, 1782.</p>

<p>So far I had written yesterday, when I resolved to delay
writing further to you till to-day, on account of the promise<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
which Townshend gave me that he would see Lord Shelburne
last night, and press him upon the subject.</p>

<p>I have been with Townshend again this morning, and yet
have nothing like a decided answer to give you. He told me
that Thurlow made the most difficulty, but that Dunning
seems to be entirely with us. Yesterday he said that Shelburne
talked much of the advantages of holding high language.
What the tenor of Conway's language was, I have stated to
you before. Of the rest I know nothing. I own I am rather
in doubt whether Lord Shelburne acts upon a system of
resuming, or only of gaining time; neither of them is very
pleasant or flattering to you.</p>

<p>Townshend appears to me to be most heartily and sincerely
with you; nothing can be more explicit than his language was
to that point. He complained of irresponsible Cabinet Ministers,
and seemed to throw it upon that. I then stated your
impatience, what you must feel, and asked how you could go
on? I took out of my pocket your three letters to me, of the
12th and 14th instant, and read him such extracts as I thought
would <i>express</i> your opinion and your impatience, and would
pretty strongly <i>imply</i> though not <i>express</i> your determination
upon the subject of resigning. He took the hint, and said that
he could not wonder at any resolution you might take, and that
he had told the Cabinet so. To this I answered, that it was
right for me not to conceal from <i>him</i> (though I did not mean
it as a <i>formal</i> declaration), that you certainly would not stay a
moment there, if you found the proposal of a Bill of recognition
either negatived or put off longer. He repeated that he could
not wonder at it. He then charged me with a commission to
write to you this evening, and to say that although nothing
was yet done, he would labour to the utmost of his power that
your wishes should be complied with, and that he hoped to
bring the business to a conclusion <i>in a very few days</i>; that in
the meantime he thought that his writing an official despatch,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
which should not be explicit, would be by no means pleasant to
you. In this I agreed most fully.</p>

<p>The difficulty, he told me, lay in bringing them to think
of anything but the peace, by which you see that business is
still <i>en train</i>.</p>

<p>This consideration makes me less eager than I should otherwise
be to cut the matter short. I continue to think, that if
they are sufficiently pressed, you will carry your point; because
I am fully persuaded they will not push you to the wall. In
the meantime they feel the situation into which the notice for
the House of Commons has thrown them; for Townshend expressed
his satisfaction at it to-day, and said it lay a necessity
on Government to do something.</p>

<p>While I am writing this, I receive your letters of the 21st.
The despatch will, I think, have a good effect in pressing the
thing forward, and assisting the exertions which I sincerely
believe Townshend will make. At the same time, as it must
now be the 27th at soonest before you can receive this letter,
which leaves everything exactly where my last despatches to you
did, I should think upon the receipt of it you would do well to
write a letter to Townshend, rather demanding than requesting
an immediate answer.</p>

<p>What I mean is (if you should approve of the idea), that you
should say, "that after having so repeatedly stated the grounds
of your proposal, to which you can now add nothing," (because
any reasoning of yours brings on more discussion) "except
that every day gives fresh force to them, you have nothing left
but to request, as your situation entitles you to do, that you
may at last have an immediate and explicit answer, in order
that on the one hand you may not disgrace your personal
honour and the faith of Great Britain by continuing to pledge
them to assurances which are not to be performed, nor on the
other hand appear by remaining in your situation without a
favourable answer, to countenance a system which your own<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
mind informs you to be at once unjust and impracticable." If
you think the expressions too strong, or not sufficiently so, you
will weaken or aggravate them; but I am very impatient to
receive some such letter, which shall <i>not</i> enter into reasons or
discussion on a subject so completely exhausted, but shall manifest
your own intention, which I am convinced will operate
more strongly than all the argument in the world.</p>

<p>You will perhaps say that I have already in my possession
such a paper. But I must own I feel great difficulty in fixing
the exact moment when to make use of it, and when to say
that I can no longer in justice to you give credit to assurances
of an immediate determination so often repeated and so often
found fallacious. With you, who have received none such,
there is no such difficulty. Besides, the letter in my hands
can only operate as an actual resignation on your behalf, and
authorized by you; whereas the letter from you, which I
propose, would operate as a threat, and by that means prevent,
I believe, the event itself; or if not, it would at least convince
your feelings, as well as mine, most unequivocally of the absolute
necessity for taking such a measure, as the only one by
which you could preserve either integrity of character or
uprightness of conduct. Such a letter might, if the winds do
not prevent it, be here in a week from this day; and before
that time I am most thoroughly convinced I shall receive not a
single word further than I have already. With such a letter
to deliver to Townshend, I should think myself authorized
to <i>demand</i> a Cabinet; or if I could not obtain that, to make
use of your former letter, and desire from you that I might see
the King, to state to him your sense of the impracticability of
such a system, and of the certainty that Government will be
compelled in October to make concessions without gaining any
advantage by them, infinitely greater than what would in
January conciliate the affections of all Ireland.</p>

<p>One way or other, this business does most certainly draw to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
a conclusion. I allow, by this proposal, one week more for
them to take their resolution. If they delay it beyond that,
it is in effect the most mortifying and the most insulting way
of refusing it that they could have adopted; and as such I
think you would do right to state it in your letter. But
whichever way it terminates, I think we shall derive the
greatest advantage from Townshend's having authorized me to
promise that on the 21st something should be done in the
English House of Commons, and having sat by and acquiesced
in my saying that <i>that</i> something would, I <i>apprehended</i>, be
brought forward by Government. If it is not, I think I need
not say what a situation they stand in; and what ours will be&mdash;how
much better than if nothing had been said. On the
other hand, if they do authorize me to bring forward, or bring
forward themselves, on that day, a satisfactory Bill, we shall
derive much more advantage to Government from having given
an early notice of it, and much more personal credit from its
coming through my mouth from you, than if it had been done
only by the Minister, and kept back till the 21st.</p>

<p>I have had no communication with Lord Shelburne, nor have
I either seen or heard from him since I spoke in the House of
Commons. I mean, however, to-morrow to write to him on
the strength of having received fresh despatches from you, and
to press him in the strongest manner, that <i>the Bill to be</i> proposed
on the 21st, may be such as will satisfy your wishes
by satisfying the people of Ireland. What the new reason for
delay will be, God knows. In the meantime is it not inconceivable
that a man will hazard so much, in every sense of the
word, so much credit as a Minister, so much in point of
character, and so much in point of weight and support to his
administration, without its being possible for one to discover
any one object under Heaven which he is to gain by the delay?
Possibly such a letter as I wish from you may succeed in
bringing him to his senses; if not, I am sure the sooner your<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
hands are washed of it the better; for if the rest of your
administration in Ireland is to go on in the same manner, and
you are to be left for months together without knowing whether
Government here will expressly support or expressly contradict
you, and all this only that they may gain time, without having
anything further to gain, such a situation is neither suited for
such tempers as we have, nor for such characters as I hope we
shall ever preserve together.</p>

<p>The real grievance seems to be, what did hang as a dead
weight upon the last administration till it pulled it down, and
what must hang as the same dead weight upon this&mdash;I mean a
Cabinet of eleven. If these are disunited, there are not wanting,
even among themselves, men to publish it to the world;
and how is it possible that they should be otherwise, except by
the means of that delightful expedient which I stated to you
once before, and which was again alluded to in yesterday's
conversation. I should hope, however, that the appearance of
your resolution will put an end to this scene of procrastination,
disgraceful to you and dangerous to the country; if it does not,
I am sure the resolution itself is most absolutely necessary to
vindicate us to ourselves, as well as to others, from the consequences
which we both foresee.</p>

<p>In the meantime, my dear brother, I cannot close this letter
without expressing to you the extreme pleasure and satisfaction
which I feel when, after having confided so much to my discretion,
you express yourself satisfied that, however unsuccessful
I may have been, the failure of my endeavours to procure this
long-expected answer has not been owing to any want of zeal
or judgment in me, but to those to whom the consequences are
really to be imputed, and who have on that account already
made themselves most deeply responsible both to God and their
country.</p>

<p>Believe me, my dear brother,<br/>
Ever most sincerely and affectionately yours,<br/>
W. W. G.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span></p>

<p>D'Ivernois is here, and going over almost immediately to
Ireland with two other <i>commissaires</i>.</p>

<p>If any decision should drop from the skies before I receive
your letter to Townshend, I will suppress it entirely.</p></div>


<div class="blockquot"><p>MR. W. W. GRENVILLE TO LORD TEMPLE.</p>

<p>Pall Mall, Dec. 25th, 1782.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Brother</span>,</p>

<p>All the effect which I hoped for by the official despatch has
been produced by the confidential communication. Townshend
has had this morning a long conversation with Lord
Shelburne, the result of which is a compliance with your wishes.
But this will be done by an official despatch, and not by a
Cabinet minute, as they cannot venture to meet a Cabinet upon
it. Still, however, I think that is sufficient for you&mdash;sufficient
to authorize you in present, and to justify you in future. I
write this in great haste, in order if possible to prevent the
measure which I recommended in my last.</p>

<p>Thurlow will probably oppose it in that House. They talk
of altering the bill, <i>but not materially</i>. I put the question
explicitly, whether it was to contain a recognition, and was
answered that it should. Townshend asked me whether you
would be likely to pledge yourself that this should satisfy, as he
thought that might possibly be expected. I said it could not
be expected that you should <i>pledge</i> yourself for madmen, but
that you certainly <i>hoped</i>. He then said that it would take a
day or two to prepare and send in circulation the despatch, and
hoped this would make no material difference. I said certainly
not, if I was allowed to state this conversation to you. To this
he agreed. Then I mentioned the dissolution. He said that
you seemed to agree that this would take effect much better
with the news of a peace, and that (he might tell me confidentially)
this must be decided within three days, unless something
very unforeseen happens.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span></p>

<p>On this idea I wait here a few days longer, and then shall
bring your despatches with me, and go back if you think it
right.</p>

<p>I think the event shows how much more strongly your determination
operated, as I said it would, than all the reasoning
possible.</p>

<p>Believe me ever,<br/>
My dear brother,<br/>
Most sincerely and affectionately yours,<br/>
W. W. G.</p></div>


<p>The "Order" referred to in the following letter is the
Order of the Knights of St. Patrick, instituted in Ireland,
under the Viceroyalty of Lord Temple, on the 5th of
February, 1783.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>MR. W. W. GRENVILLE TO LORD TEMPLE.</p>

<p>Pall Mall, Dec. 28th, 1782.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Brother</span>,</p>

<p>As, in consequence of your letter of the 25th, I mean to stay
over the 21st of January, I write immediately to explain to you
what I referred to in my last about the Order. It is not of
any very great importance; but as I then expected to have
seen you in a few days, I thought I should be able to explain it
better by word of mouth.</p>

<p>It relates to the difficulty of reconciling the business of the
Commoners who have been talked of for it, with the King's
strong approbation of your only having proposed sixteen, and
his very great disinclination, which Townshend has repeatedly
expressed to me, to increase the number even to eighteen or
twenty. I suppose you mean sixteen <i>exclusive</i> of the Sovereign
and Grand Master. I apprehend Conolly, Ponsonby, O'Neill,
and Daly to have been talked of. The difficulty is greater, because
I understand that the two first have more than once refused<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
peerages. This, however, you will arrange as you think best.
The King was pleased with the motto, <i>Quis separabit?</i> To this
would apply very well the Collar which Hawkins told me had
been thought of, of trefoils and roses alternate. Townshend
will write, or has wrote, to you for a plan, which plan is meant
to include Badges, and all other playthings belonging to it.
You'll break Percy's heart if you settle it all without him.
Pray oblige me, as a herald, so far as to appoint a genealogist,
and to make the Knights deliver in pedigrees three descents
back at least: that is the number in the Garter Statutes, which
I send to you. The Thistle and Bath have both genealogists&mdash;the
last must be an arduous office. I do not apprehend that
the names are meant to be sent as part of the plan, nor indeed
can you do that yet. Do you offer one to the <i>Nolo Privy
Councillari</i>, or do you draw the line of none but Privy Councillors?</p>

<p>I called the other day on the Archbishop of Cashel, and was
told that he was gone for Ireland; but I'll know in a day or
two. Adieu.</p>

<p>Ever yours,<br/>
W. W. G.</p>

<p>The King seems to expect to get two Red Ribands by it&mdash;Lord
A. and Lord B. Query the latter.</p></div>


<div class="blockquot"><p>MR. W. W. GRENVILLE TO LORD TEMPLE.</p>

<p>Pall Mall, Dec. 30th, 1782.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Brother</span>,</p>

<p>I have been with Townshend this morning, and have had a
long conversation with him. He showed me his despatch to
you, and that brought on the conversation, which I managed
so that I might at any time have produced your last letter; but
upon the whole I thought it better not shown, although the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
words of his despatch are certainly by no means satisfactory.
He spoke very openly to me, and said that as his despatch had
been written without the concurrence of Cabinet, he thought
he could hazard no more. In this I could not but agree with
him, especially as it gave me occasion to press upon him, for
his sake as well as yours, the necessity of something being
finally settled.</p>

<p>He then went at large into the difficulties. He was convinced,
he said, that it would come in the end to your proposition.
But in the meantime Thurlow was against it, and
meant to oppose the Bill; and Shelburne wanted to be forced
to it, and said that he was sure a stand would be to be made
somewhere; and why not now? I answered that it did not
seem to me the most prudent step to choose a post where no
man of any description would stand by you. We had much
more conversation of the same sort. There were those, Townshend
said, who had said that as the preliminaries were expected
soon, it would come with better grace then. But, continued
he, if we wait till then, I am afraid it may not come at all. To
this I answered, that this was exactly my idea, but in the
meantime, was it not fit you should know on what ground you
stood? He said so; and (he went on) see where we should be
in that case. The Lord-Lieutenant would not stay an hour.
Here he stopped, as waiting my answer. I immediately said,
most certainly not. And then the person who succeeds him
will be to wait on you. You know better than I do the situation
of things and men. Tell me to whom I am to apply. To
the Duke of Portland's people?&mdash;to the old Court and Lord
Shannon?&mdash;to Hood and his set? I went on a good deal more
in the same strain, and ended with saying that he could not be
astonished, or even at all surprised, that every day should
increase your impatience. This was to prepare him for your
peremptory despatch, which, if my subsequent letters have not
stopped, I shall now most certainly deliver. He told me that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
on Wednesday he should see most of his colleagues, and he
should then hope to have some answer to give me.</p>

<p>I threw out one idea to him, which I said proceeded entirely
from myself: and therefore, if he mentioned it at all, it should
be as a thing to be proposed to you, and not as one coming
from you. It was that, as it would probably be thought right
that the matter should be discussed in a Committee of the whole
House as a foundation for bringing in the Bill, such terms
might be used in the resolutions of that Committee as should
obviate the difficulty which was made upon the idea of the
preamble's referring to past rights. I then mentioned in
general words my idea for those resolutions, but did not give
them to him in writing. I have since reduced them to writing,
and enclose them to you for your ideas upon them. I mean
to-morrow to read them to Townshend, in order to explain my
idea fully, but not to leave them with him. The first resolution
is copied almost verbatim from the addresses. If you turn to
them, you will see what I have omitted, and that I have
inserted nothing but what I thought absolutely necessary, in
order not to clog the resolution, and render it thereby less
perspicuous.</p>

<p>Pray let me have your ideas on this as soon as possible. I
still think your preamble will at last be consented to: but a
pressing despatch, to be used or not, as occasion requires, can
do no harm.</p>

<p>Believe me,<br/>
My dearest brother,<br/>
Most affectionately and sincerely yours,<br/>
W. W. G.</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span></p>

Cabinet Interregnum&mdash;The Coalition Ministry&mdash;Resignation
of Lord Temple.</h3>


<p>The impediments and delays Mr. Grenville had to
encounter in his negotiations with Ministers, are sufficiently
detailed in the preceding correspondence. They appear to
have originated chiefly with Lord Shelburne, who, in the
line of conduct he pursued on this occasion, betrayed
either a singular indifference to the state of Ireland, or
an inexcusable ignorance of it. For the latter, indeed,
he had no reasonable excuse, since the suspense of the
public mind, and the growing discontents of the people,
were constantly pressed upon his attention by Lord
Temple and Mr. Grenville. There certainly was no
shadow of pretence for not thoroughly understanding
the whole merits of the question at issue between the
two kingdoms, and still less for not setting it at rest
at once, as the Ministry did at last, and must have
intended to do in some shape all throughout. Yet it was
not until the beginning of January, 1783, after nearly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
six weeks of incessant representations and harassing interviews
with Lord Shelburne, Pitt and Townshend, that the
mission of the Irish Secretary assumed a definite shape, and
that something like a distinct hope was held out of its
being brought, at last, to a satisfactory conclusion.</p>

<p>Lord Shelburne appears to have been desirous of postponing
the Irish difficulty until after he should have
succeeded in securing the peace, for which he was then
treating with France. He thought that a measure, however
just and indispensable in itself, emanating from a
strong Government, would be received as a graceful concession,
while the same measure, granted by a Government
which had been described early in the preceding
December by Lord Mornington (afterwards Marquis of
Wellesley) as subsisting solely on the divisions of its enemies,
might seem to be wrung from the embarrassments
of the Administration. This shuffling policy, and want of
magnanimity in the Minister&mdash;this coquetting with extremities,
in the forlorn hope of extracting from them some
advantage for a sinking Government, pervaded the councils
of the Cabinet, and led finally to its downfall.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile, agitation was rising into open manifestations
of distrust and resentment in Ireland. The
Volunteers, whose nationality had been appeased by the
recent Repeal of the Declaratory Law, renewed their
demands for a specific measure, by which the legislative
and judicial independence of the country, guaranteed by
that Repeal, should be unconditionally recognized, and
placed beyond doubt or cavil. Their suspicions were
excited by the hesitation of the Imperial Government,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
and their indignation was roused by the fact that, in
contravention of the settlement by Act of Parliament
of the rights of Ireland, an Irish case had been heard in
an English court of law, and decided by Lord Mansfield.
The circumstances were irritating, and peculiarly calculated
to shake the confidence of so sensitive a race
in the sincerity of their rulers. Nor were there wanting
persons who were ready to avail themselves, for factious
purposes, of every fresh symptom of national disquietude
to inflame the passions of the people. At the head of
these disturbing patriots were Lord Beauchamp and
Mr. Flood; fortunately, on the other side, was Mr.
Grattan, whose pure patriotism, confiding in the honour
and justice of the Imperial Legislature, resisted all violent
demands, until a fair opportunity had been afforded to
England to vindicate the integrity of a settlement, the
principle of which was clear, and admitted on all hands.
His language on this point, in reply to an Address from
the Volunteers, was explicit: "I know of no circumstance,
except one, which has really happened to alarm
you: the entertaining and deciding by the Court of
King's Bench, in England, an Irish cause, is, no doubt,
a very great infringement. You do not imagine that
I mean to rest under it; but I shall never suppose such
a measure to be the act of England, unless her Parliament
shall hesitate to do it away in a manner the most clear,
comprehensive and satisfactory." Mr. Grattan's firmness
stayed the impetuous course of the Volunteers; but it was
at the cost of his immediate popularity, and, as it afterwards
proved, at the imminent risk of his personal safety.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span></p>

<p>It was while these events were taking place in Ireland,
that Lord Temple and Mr. Grenville were urging upon
the Administration the imperative necessity of bringing
forward a measure that should satisfy the apprehensions
of the Irish people. With that view a Bill, known by
the title of the Bill of Renunciation, was prepared by
Lord Temple and forwarded to Mr. Grenville. Upon
the structure, and not upon the substance, of this Bill,
innumerable quibbles were raised. The difficulty with
Lord Shelburne was, not the renunciation itself, for that
was nothing more than a confirmation of the repeal, but
the technical form in which it was to be expressed.
Nobody dreamt of disturbing or evading the principle of
the measure which this Bill simply declared anew and fortified
by a more distinct enunciation; but Ministers could
not agree upon the words&mdash;for into a discussion about
words the whole negotiation finally degenerated. And thus,
the fear of compromising the dignity of England by some
unguarded expression, or of failing from over caution to
satisfy the demands of Ireland, had the effect of protracting
the passage of a measure, upon the substantive justice and
urgent necessity of which all parties were unanimous.</p>

<p>At length Mr. Grenville was enabled to announce to his
brother that these petty discussions were brought to a satisfactory
close. But the issue, as will be subsequently seen,
was not quite so near as he supposed. The Administration
had wasted so much time in verbal criticisms,
that, although they had the merit of ultimately introducing
the Bill into Parliament, they were obliged to bequeath the
satisfaction of earning it to their successors.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>MR. W. W. GRENVILLE TO LORD TEMPLE</p>

<p>Pall Mall, Jan. 2nd, 1783.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Brother</span>,</p>

<p>After the many changes and delays which have occurred in
the course of this business, I think I may at last congratulate
you, and what is infinitely more, the two kingdoms, on its
being brought to such an issue as you desire.</p>

<p>I told you in my last despatch that Townshend seemed to me
much alarmed lest he should have gone too far in his letter to
you, and that at the same time I had assured him that you
would not think he went far enough, as the whole question
turned upon the point of recognition, which was very distantly
alluded to in his letter. When I saw him yesterday, his alarms
appeared to be increased. This morning, however, he told me
that he had been with Conway, who understood his authority to
be quite sufficient for what he had done, and with Lord Shelburne,
who said that it was a damned thing, and that he
wished Lord Temple would have stood it, but that it could not
be helped, and that he (Townshend) must therefore think over
with the Crown lawyers such a preamble as should recognize in
future, without any retrospect whatever. To this point Townshend
said he thought your Bill went; and therefore he told me
he was to send it down in that shape in which you sent it
(excepting the omission of the words <i>of right</i> in the two places
where they occur) to Lord Camden for his opinion. I then
mentioned what I had hinted to him before in the way of
resolutions, which might, I thought, be so drawn as to preclude
the idea of retrospect. He wished to see the form I had
adopted; upon which I gave him, as coming from myself only,
the enclosed paper, which you will see differs a little from that
which I sent you before. Both these he sent to Lord Camden,
with a letter, desiring that he and myself might see him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
to-morrow morning for his ideas on the subject. You will
observe that <i>he</i> is from principle warm for Irish claims; and
therefore I think it not a bad quarter to begin with.</p>

<p>I flatter myself you will approve of my reason for withholding
your despatch No. 16, as the word <i>courts</i>, without <i>of law</i>,
which we have scratched out, certainly includes the Peers; and
nothing would have been so agreeable to Lords T. and S.
as a point of form which they need not have mentioned
till towards the conclusion of the business, and so might
completely have gained their darling object&mdash;time.</p>

<p>Still, however, I thought much of that letter&mdash;too important
to be lost&mdash;and therefore threw it together into the enclosed
paper, which I sent to Townshend the night before last,
together with a copy of such parts of his despatches as authorized
you to pledge the faith of Government, <i>he having asked
me for them, not for himself</i>.</p>

<p>While I was still in a state of suspense, your letter and
despatch of the 29th reached me. I thought it best to keep
the latter till this morning, when, I need hardly say, I did not
deliver it, though I thought proper to read it to Townshend, in
order, as I told him, that he might be perfectly acquainted with
your feelings on the occasion, and might see I had not exaggerated
them. You will remember that your next despatch is
numbered 16. If it comes before you receive this, I will
alter it. To-morrow you shall know the result of Lord Camden's
conversation, upon which much I think depends; though after
what has now passed, I have no idea of the possibility of their
drawing back again, even if they were so inclined.</p>

<p>Brooke's business, Jemmy tells me, passed the Treasury yesterday.</p>

<p>You will have had an answer, such as it is, about the Duke
of L. and Hussey Burgh.</p>

<p>With regard to Perry, I have written to you already fully on
the subject.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span></p>

<p>I have talked once or twice about Portugal; but they want
exceedingly to be quickened, <i>l&agrave;-dessus</i>.</p>

<p>Townshend desires to make you an apology through me, and
will do it himself when he writes, for the delay. From him no
apology whatever is necessary. Adieu.</p>

<p>My dear brother,<br/>
Ever yours,<br/>
W. W. G.</p>

<p>When I pressed Lord Shelburne about Hussey Burgh, he said
he thought there would be no objection to promising him that he
should be made as soon as any one. I stated this to Townshend
this morning, who is to speak to the King about it again
to-morrow.</p></div>


<p>About this time another subject was engaging the
earnest attention of Lord Temple&mdash;the foundation (already
alluded to) of an Order of Knighthood in Ireland. Several
letters relating to the details of the institution, and the
claims of different noblemen to be admitted into it, passed
between Mr. Grenville and his brother. The following
is selected as a specimen:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>MR. W. W. GRENVILLE TO LORD TEMPLE.</p>

<p>Pall Mall, Jan. 7th, 1783.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Brother</span>,</p>

<p>Although I think there is every reason to hope that I shall
be able to send you by a messenger, either to-night or to-morrow
morning at furthest, the result of the Cabinet, which,
after having been postponed ever since Sunday, is at last to be
held this evening; yet, as I know by experience, that it may be
again deferred, I would not omit writing to you by post express<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
upon a subject which you will perhaps think trifling in itself.
I went this morning to Townshend, with your despatches of
the 2nd instant, upon which we had very little conversation,
except his assurances of bringing the business to an end this
evening. After that I turned the conversation to your Order,
and read him the names. To my utter astonishment, he started
a doubt whether my Lord Courtown <i>would take it</i>. To which
I answered, that the first names in the list having signified
their consent, undoubtedly it was not a thing to be offered
where there was the least chance of a refusal. He then said
that he would take upon him to sound Lord Courtown; and
that, as he was his brother-in-law, he would throw out to him
that a thing of the sort was in agitation; and that if Lord
Courtown should like it, he believed that <i>he, Townshend</i>, would
have interest enough to <i>procure it for him</i>. It was impossible
for me to tell Townshend, or even to give him to understand
what nevertheless certainly ought to have occurred to him, that
it would but ill answer your purpose, whatever it was, in recommending
Lord Courtown, that the merit of it should be ascribed
to him.</p>

<p>I had nothing, therefore, left but to drop the conversation,
and to write to you, as I now do, immediately on my return
home, to suggest to you whether it would not be worth your
while, without affecting to know anything of this, to write to
Lord Courtown to offer it, and perhaps to Townshend, to make
a great merit with him of the recommendation of his brother-in-law,
as the only non-resident Knight. The sooner you
send in the list and plan, &amp;c., &amp;c., undoubtedly the better.</p>

<p>Your names appear to me all unexceptionable, except possibly
Lord Bechoe, who you know will give some trouble to the
heralds to make out whether his father, who was a grazier,
ever had a father of his own. But he is a man of great fortune,
and a steady friend of Government, and I should think might
pass. Lord Nugent's refusal leaves a vacancy. I own I should<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
be inclined to Lord Mountgarret as the senior Viscount, which
would show that it was not to be exclusively confined to Earls,
at the same time that no other person could pretend the same
claims with so old a peer, the senior Viscount, and the first
man in rank of so great a family. Besides, this might detach
Butler, of the county Kilkenny, from Flood; and it is surely a
great object to cut him off from all hopes of the county, as that
would give him an appearance of popularity, &amp;c., &amp;c. Unless
you do something of this sort, shall you not apprehend affronting
the lower orders of the peerage? If Lord Kinsale was not
what he is, I should wish for him on the same account, but
that is impossible. Pray consider the other well, for it strikes
me as important.</p>

<p>I return you the Derry Papers. Townshend is to search his
office for their intercepted correspondence here, which I will
send you.</p>

<p>Bulkeley wrote me the enclosed, to which I returned an ostensible
answer, referring to you, but at the same time distinguishing
between a pension, and provision out of the revenue
for a revenue officer's widow.</p>

<p>Townshend sends you McLaughlin's petition and case.
What does Lord Beauchamp mean by his letter to the "Vol."
about the King's speech?</p>

<p>Pray desire Lady Temple not to forget Lord Nugent's velvet,
or he will be outrageous.</p>

<p>Believe me, ever yours,<br/>
W. W. G.</p></div>


<p>One good result had been attained by the perseverance
with which Mr. Grenville pursued his object with Ministers
in reference to the Renunciation Bill, and the consistency
he observed in maintaining the policy which he and
Lord Temple knew to be essential to the security of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
British power in Ireland. If that policy was not carried
out, Lord Temple was relieved from all responsibility,
and was prepared to relinquish into other hands the confusion
and disorder which he could not obtain the means
of ameliorating. As Mr. Grenville observes in the following
letter, he was "completely master of his own ground;"
he had clearly stated, and constantly urged his views of
the only course that could be followed with safety or
credit; and if he failed in carrying them into effect, the
<i>onus</i> would rest with the Administration. Happily he
did not fail. The Bill was shaped and passed; but the
obstacles which impeded it, and which are detailed in
subsequent letters, rendered its ultimate success doubtful
up to the last moment.</p>

<p>Looking back, at this distance of time, upon the curious
struggle which took place in the Cabinet on this question,
we cannot fail to be struck by the immense disproportion
between cause and effect exhibited in this strange episode
in the history of the Shelburne Administration. The full
recognition of the rights of Ireland had received the concurrent
sanction of the Legislatures of both kingdoms only
a short time before. No doubt whatever existed as to
the intention of the repeal of the Declaratory Law. The
Volunteers, to whose energetic demonstrations that healing
measure was mainly attributable, were thoroughly
satisfied, and, instead of displaying their nationality in
angry and defiant resolutions, they adopted the language
of congratulation and enthusiastic allegiance to the Government.
This felicitous state of things was suddenly interrupted
by one of those incidents which no foresight could<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
have anticipated, and which, absolutely trivial in itself, was
magnified at once, by the jealous spirit of patriotism, into
a violation of the solemn compact that had just been
ratified on both sides of the Channel. An Irish cause was
brought into an English court of justice, was heard in the
ordinary way, like any other cause, without reference to
the competency of the tribunal before which it was tried,
and decided, as a matter of course, by Lord Mansfield.
The remedy for this contravention of the notorious settlement
of the judicial independence of Ireland was plain.
The decision was waste paper: it could not be carried
into effect. The Irish might have rested satisfied with
the power which they possessed of nullifying and rejecting
the authority of the English Judge. But the delays of
the Cabinet awakened their suspicions, and they apprehended,
not, perhaps, very unnaturally, that if they
suffered this single case of illegal interference to pass
without some decisive declaration on the part of the
English Legislature, it would be wrested into a precedent
for further and still more dangerous innovations.
Mr. Grattan held this opinion also, but trusted implicitly
to the honour of the English Parliament for a measure
that should fully set at rest all uneasiness on the subject;
while Lord Temple was so impressed with the propriety of
adopting such a measure that he drew up the Bill of
Renunciation, which, after much superfluous discussion,
ultimately passed into a law.</p>

<p>The case itself, however, lay in the narrowest compass,
and admitted of the simplest solution. The Irish cause
which had occasioned all this trouble, and menaced so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
seriously the tranquillity of the country, had been entered
for hearing <i>before</i> the operation of the Repeal, but delayed
by some accident until a subsequent term. The reason
why it was not dismissed when it came before the court
was, that the time had elapsed for pleading against the
competency of the court, pleadings having already begun
upon the matter of the suit. The parties could not plead
to the writ&mdash;to use the legal phraseology&mdash;because they
had already pleaded in chief. The only time when,
according to the practice of the court, the competency of
the court could be objected to was when the cause was
entered; but at that time the objection did not exist, and
when the cause came on for hearing it was too late. Lord
Mansfield took the cause without any reference to the
special circumstances attending it, which he was not
judicially called upon to notice. He acted strictly on the
practice of the court; and, although it was held by some
of the statesmen of the day that he ought to have taken
a more enlarged view of so peculiar a case, it was the
opinion of Mr. Fox that he could not have acted otherwise
than he did. At all events, the case could never
have been drawn into a precedent. The real point for
consideration, upon which Mr. Fox&mdash;who had himself
framed the Act of Repeal&mdash;entertained some doubts, was
whether the Repeal was sufficiently minute and comprehensive
in its scope, to extinguish the right of appeal
in Irish cases, by writs of error, to the King's Bench of
Great Britain. But this point was not raised, on its
special merits, by Lord Mansfield's decision, which involved
nothing more than a technical question arising<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
out of the practice of the court. It was wise to allay
the feverish anxiety of the people, by removing any obscurity
that hung over the settlement of the separate judicature
of Ireland; but, such being clearly the intention of
the Imperial Legislature, it is difficult to understand why
it should have entailed so much clamour and misunderstanding.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>MR. W. W. GRENVILLE TO LORD TEMPLE.</p>

<p>Pall Mall, Jan. 8th, 1783.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Brother</span>,</p>

<p>This morning I received your letter and despatch of the 3rd
and 4th instant, and soon after, the enclosed note from Townshend.
The general idea is, that they have received the exceedingly
bad news of their negotiation being totally at an end;
and the style of this letter seems, I must own, to confirm it.
Before I close this letter, which shall not be till to-night, I
shall most probably know with certainty. If it should be so,
I see nothing in Lord Shelburne's conduct throughout this
business, which can prevent me from being convinced that he
has foreseen this conclusion, that the <i>acquiescence</i> is to be
ascribed to that foresight, and to an intention of pledging you
to some very strong measure to be immediately proposed to
Ireland&mdash;of men, money, or some other support; and that his
language about peace was calculated for no other purpose than
that of making to himself a merit which he had not, and
inducing me to pledge you with less difficulty to something
of this sort, in the <i>improbable event</i> of a continuation of the
war. If that should have been his aim, I have at least the
consolation to reflect that I made none but a <i>very</i> general
answer to that part of his conversation to which I allude, and
which I stated to you at length in a former letter.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span></p>

<p>At the same time, I must freely own that I have been duped
upon the subject of peace; not so much by their assurances,
strong as those have been, and often as they have been repeated,
as by the opinion which I then held, and which I have not
much altered now, that a peace was absolutely necessary to
their system of government. However, be all this as it may,
I think you are in a situation to <i>voir venir</i>, and to rest upon
your oars in full confidence that you are now completely
master of your own ground, whether you are to be left to carry
on the Government of Ireland upon those principles on which
you have begun it, and on which alone we know it can be
carried on with success, or whether the system is to be altered,
and committed, of course, to other hands; in which there is no
doubt but that the ill-success and confusion that must follow
will justify your predictions to such a degree, and place your
character in such a light, as would almost make it an event to
be wished for by you, if it was not so fatal to the interests of
both countries.</p>

<p>And this brings me to another point, in which I am very
happy to feel myself justified and confirmed by your instructions
in that line of conduct which I had fully resolved to
adopt. I mean the holding out the most peremptory refusal
to making either you or myself at all a party to postponing the
business beyond the 21st, except in the single instance of their
having some proposition to bring forward then, about their
negotiations, of such a nature as to make the reason obvious
to the mind of every man in Ireland, as well as in England.
In such a case I will acquiesce, because I think I cannot in
decency avoid it, under the delay of one day only. In every
other case which can be supposed, I will claim a right to state
to the House that the delay is neither consented to by you, nor
arises from you; but is in your idea most pernicious. Surely,
my own character and honour, as well as your's, demand this
from me.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span></p>

<p>I am sick to death of this scene. Since I wrote the first
part of my letter I have been to the lev&eacute;e, where I saw Townshend,
and learnt from him that Lord Camden had taken upon
himself to draw up a new preamble, which was <i>to soften on
both sides</i>.&mdash;(What the meaning of this curious expression is, I
will not pretend to say.) I then said, that at least I hoped it
would contain an <i>explicit</i> recognition; because the measure
would only be useful, in proportion as it <i>was</i> explicit. He
agreed with me, as he had always done, and wished that I had
seen Lord Camden. I asked if he was in town; he said he
was to go back to-day to Chiselhurst, and had desired <i>him</i> to
hold the council, <i>in his absence, on Friday</i>. I immediately
went home, and wrote to Lord Camden, desiring to be allowed
to wait upon him; but he was gone. I have just sent your
despatch of the 4th, with the enclosed note to Townshend,
which I hope will find him before dinner. How little does all
this agree with Lord Shelburne's idea of doing what would be
most satisfactory, and with all my fine reasoning at the beginning
of my letter!</p>

<p>I will certainly write to you more when I come back from
dinner; and, if I <i>can</i> make him, Townshend shall write too,
because they cannot, upon paper, assign any good reason for
the delay, and a bad one will give you advantages. Upon the
whole, what a scene it is!</p>

<p>The news at Court was, that the negotiations are not broke
off, only delayed; and this I take to be the real case, as no
letter has been written to the Lord Mayor. If that be so,
I shall of course hear no more of it to-day.</p>

<p>Elliott is to have a Red Ribband.</p>

<p>Jan. 10.</p>

<p>I have delayed finishing this letter till this morning, in the
vain hope of being able to get something specific to propose to
you. After dinner, on the 8th, Townshend produced Lord<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
Camden's preamble. I send you a copy of it, and need not,
I am sure, observe to you how unsatisfactory it is to Ireland,
and how humiliating to Great Britain; and how perfect an
ignorance it shows, after all that has passed, of that business
which is referred to him for a decision. Neither Lord Shelburne,
Townshend, nor Pitt, who were present, attempted to
defend it against the observations I made upon it.</p>

<p>Some conversation passed upon it, after which Townshend
went away. The conversation then turned more particularly
upon what was to be done, in which the only very settled idea
that I could find was, that your preamble was not to be
adopted.</p>

<p>Pitt then threw out the idea of declaring the intention of the
Act of Repeal, and making the new enacting clause a consequence
of the principles then adopted. We talked this over
a little. I pressed for something being settled to send over to
you. The answer Lord Shelburne gave me was, that the
Cabinet lawyers were all dispersed, and without them nothing
could be finally settled. Pitt then went away. I continued
the conversation, and asked Lord Shelburne if it would not be
right, as he had approved of Pitt's idea, that I should see Pitt,
and endeavour to put something upon paper upon it. In this
he agreed.</p>

<p>When I went home, I sent the enclosed note to Pitt, and in
consequence of it saw him yesterday morning. I was near two
hours with him, drawing up something of a form. At last, the
Bill No. 1. was settled: more, I believe, because we were both
tired out with weighing words, than for any great merit that I
see in it. However, at the time I thought it might do; but in
the course of the day, thinking it over, I disliked it, and sent
the form No. 2. to Pitt, who desired to see me again. When
I went to him, he proposed, after some conversation, the
Bill No. 3., which I took to consider.</p>

<p>But, in the meantime, I am <i>au dernier point</i> at a loss what<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
to do in it; because, after an absence of six weeks, I know no
more of the present ideas of people in Ireland, and of the
squabbles and distinctions of words on which the whole turns,
than the Ministers here do; and less, God knows, I cannot
know! If you wait till something is formally sent you, I
shall certainly be reduced to the necessity either of putting
the business off, or of doing something in a hurry, without
knowing whether it be right or wrong. For you may depend
upon it, that neither will any of the unlearned Ministers pledge
themselves to a specific form, nor will the learned come from
their rural retreats one hour before the 17th.</p>

<p>In this situation I feel myself obliged to lay upon my oars,
and to entreat you to return the messenger as soon as possible,
to say whether any and which of the forms will do, or what
kind of thing I am to press for; for I am thrown quite wide.
Your old preamble they will not adopt except compelled to it.
What their objection is I cannot find; but most likely it is the
dear delight of alteration that operates upon them. If you
think that nothing short of saying "They have now the right"
will do, for God's sake say so explicitly in a despatch. I have
never quite lost my patience in this cursed business till this
moment, and I confess now I cannot quite preserve it. After
having carried the great point against their will and inclination,
we shall now be ruined by their delay and their damned
country-houses.</p>

<p>If you don't like any of these forms I send you, and yet
will not <i>propose</i> any other, for God's sake send one over to me
that <i>I</i> may propose it, or bring their's as near as possible to it.
Pray return your messenger as soon as you can, for this disappointment
and anxiety works me more than I can express to
you. Adieu.</p>

<p>Believe me, my dearest brother,<br/>
Most affectionately yours,<br/>
W. W. G.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span></p>

<p>You will observe that these cursed delays have driven us so
near the mark, that it will be impossible for me to hear from
you again before the 21st. You will, therefore, send me your
full determination on every point, and in every case that you
can foresee. Nobody can feel more than I do the painful
necessity of being obliged to act upon my own judgment upon
the general contents of your letters, instead of acting up to any
specific idea. What increases my difficulty is the whole matter
having arisen since I left Ireland, and my consequent ignorance
of the language of individuals on every other part of the
subject, except the preamble you sent over, to which they were
pledged. Would to God that they would adhere to that!</p>

<p>Ever yours,<br/>
W. W. G.</p>

<p>Pray return Lord Camden's preamble.</p></div>


<div class="blockquot"><p>MR. W. W. GRENVILLE TO LORD TEMPLE.</p>

<p>Pall Mall, Jan. 19th, 1783.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Brother</span>,</p>

<p>I received last night your letters of the 15th, and this morning
went to Townshend with them. We proceeded together to
the Premier's, who expressed great dissatisfaction at the contents
of your despatch. We had a good deal of conversation
about it, which ended in Townshend's proposing that <i>he</i> should
on Tuesday move for leave to bring in the Bill, and that in the
meantime your opinion might be taken on the preamble proposed
by Lord Ashburton. I thought it worth while to fall in
with this idea, provided, as I expressed myself, that the motion
was made on Tuesday, and in such words as should be pledges
to Ireland of satisfaction.</p>

<p>My reason for this, was my wish that you should have an
opportunity of seeing the enclosed preamble, which Townshend
is to send you formally to-night, and judging upon it. You<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
see it is directly adverse to the principle of recognition; still,
as it is so very strong as to the future, and the doubts being
capable of being referred to Lord Mansfield's decision, I cannot
help hoping that it may do. On the other hand, it will
certainly pass the two Houses better; because Lord Mansfield,
the Chancellor, Lord Loughborough <i>and Lord Ashburton</i>, will,
in the case of a recognition, protest against the repeal being
at all conclusive or satisfactory. This would be strong for us
to meet, and therefore I think you may fairly take the new
ground; express your adherence to your old opinion, that the
Bill does not contradict it, but that it was an object to carry it
with as little opposition and to make it as generally satisfactory
as possible.</p>

<p>I am to apologize to you in the strongest manner for not
adhering to your positive instructions. But in such a case,
and at this distance, one must act much on one's own judgment;
and I cannot help thinking that if you had been on the
spot, you would have done the same, considering how far they
are pledged by Townshend's motion, and that there will be
little <i>appearance</i> of delay.</p>

<p>Jemmy agrees in opinion with me. I write this in great
hurry, and need not exhort you to return an answer as early as
possible. I have not at all pledged you to approve of Lord
Ashburton's preamble, which, <i>au contraire</i>, I have combatted
here, but have said: "I am incapable of judging," &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

<p>Ever yours,<br/>
W. W. G.</p>

<p>You must not be angry with Townshend for sending Lord
Ashburton's Bill for your consideration, as I have taken that
upon myself to him.</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>MR. W. W. GRENVILLE TO LORD TEMPLE.</p>

<p>Pall Mall, Jan. 22nd, 1783.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Brother</span>,</p>

<p>I sit down to give you a mere outline of what passed to-day.
Townshend said that, in pursuance of the notice given before
the holidays, he rose to submit to the House a proposition on
the subject of Ireland; that he did not intend to go into the
subject, but only to move for leave to bring in a Bill. He then
read the motion; disclaimed every idea of impeaching the
settlement of last year; stated that Lord Mansfield could not
do otherwise; but that this had had the effect of increasing the
doubts that had arisen in Ireland; that it was the intention of
Government to leave no possibility of cavil upon the exclusive
rights of judicature and legislation.</p>

<p>I seconded the motion, and said, That as the motion which
was made went only to the bringing in a Bill, it was not my
intention to trouble the House with much upon the subject;
but that in the situation in which I stood I could not, consistently
with those feelings which pressed so strongly upon me,
and with my sense of the duty I owed to both kingdoms,
refrain from expressing the sincere and heartfelt pleasure I
received from seeing the business brought forward by Government
in the earliest moment, and the eager and earnest wish of
my heart that the Bill to be brought in in consequence of this
motion might obtain the end proposed by it, and set those
questions for ever at rest which it was hoped that the transaction
of the last year had fully and finally quieted; that here
I must disavow in the strongest manner all intention of casting
any reflection, or of acquiescing in any reflection, which might
be cast on the honour and integrity of the transaction of last
year as conducted by the Government of this country, and by
the gentlemen who treated with Government on the part of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
Ireland; that those gentlemen had acted as true and sincere
friends to their country, and to the harmony of the empire;
that the right honourable gentleman who then moved the
business in that House had declared at that time, and had
repeated the declaration a few days ago, that those gentlemen
treated with him upon the expressed and avowed principle of
putting an end to every idea of legislation and jurisdiction on
the part of Great Britain over Ireland; that as such I considered
it; that the right honourable gentleman had also
stated the reasons which operated, and I thought operated
wisely, against the adoption of other ideas which had then
occurred; that the dignity and honour of Ireland was too
nearly connected with, and too inseparable from, the dignity
and honour of Great Britain, to make them desire that Great
Britain should humble herself by an acknowledgment that the
right which she had so long exercised had been usurped; that,
on the other hand, it would have been absurd to have asserted
the right at the very moment that it was to be abandoned for
ever: such an assertion could answer no good end, and could
only serve to wound the feelings of a nation whom it was
intended by that transaction to bind by the strongest ties of
affection, as they were already bound by the strongest ties of
interest, with Great Britain. These were the reasons why it
had been brought forward in the manner in which it had; and
every friend to both countries, or to either, must certainly wish
that it had proved satisfactory. But it could not be concealed
that doubts had arisen upon the operation and effect of the
transaction, and that if such doubts had prevailed&mdash;if from
reasons, possibly ill-founded, they had been adopted by many
well-intentioned men, and if those doubts had been strengthened
by the late decision of the Court of King's Bench,
however necessary that decision might be, from the circumstance
of the cause having been set down for hearing before
anything had passed in the House on the subject of Ireland,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
and if that decision induced a necessity&mdash;as it certainly did&mdash;of
passing a Bill for preventing any writ of error from being
received, it was surely an act of policy and magnanimity in
Great Britain, it was consistent with the honour and dignity of
the House to set that question for ever at rest by an authentic
and solemn avowal of that which was avowed by all the parties
to the transaction, and to place upon the records of Parliament a
lasting monument of the good faith and justice of Great
Britain.</p>

<p>It was with this view that I gave my most hearty consent and
support to this motion; with this view that I hoped it would meet,
not only with the general support, but, if I might be allowed
to hope so much, with the unanimous concurrence of the
House; because I wished very much to show to Ireland that it
was the unanimous determination of the House to abide by
those principles which had been unanimously adopted in the
last session, which had at the opening of the present session
received His Majesty's approbation, and had met again with the
unanimous approbation of both Houses in their Addresses to
the Throne; and because I wished also to demonstrate that
nothing which had happened since last year&mdash;that no change
which had taken place in the Government, either here or in
Ireland; no alteration of the circumstances of this country,
either with regard to Ireland or to the rest of the world; and
particularly nothing of that which I hoped I, an uninformed
man, might be allowed to call the near hope and prospect of
peace&mdash;had made any difference whatever in those sentiments of
justice, of liberality and of affection to Ireland which had
actuated and, I trusted, ever would actuate, the conduct of the
Parliament of Great Britain.</p>

<p>After this there was a long conversation rather than debate.</p>

<p>Eden said that he did not mean to oppose the motion; but
that when he proposed the repeal last year, he had given his
opinion that it would be and ought to be satisfactory. In the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
first opinion he was confirmed by the following paragraph in
the Addresses: "Gratified in this, we const:" &amp;c., &amp;c.; that
he thought the other was equally evident from the transaction
itself, &amp;c.; but that from the moment he found that the
contrary idea was taken up by Mr. Walsh's precision, by
Mr. Flood's prodigious ability, and by the Recorder's integrity,
he knew it would prevail. He then said that there were still
matters which required adjustment; and instanced several acts
made Irish by Yelverton's Bill, which would expire in this
country in the case of peace, and the re-enacting of which
would not prevent their dropping in Ireland; but I own I
doubt this on the construction of Yelverton's Bill.</p>

<p>Fitzpatrick said he did not mean to oppose this Bill; but at
the same time he was exceedingly sorry that the motion went
beyond the mere case of judicature which called for the interference
of Parliament; that it professed to remove jealousies
and discontents; that this was impossible; that there would
always be found men to start grounds of jealousies, &amp;c.&mdash;men
whose consequence arose only from ferment; that the body of
the country was satisfied; spoke a good deal at different times
about the Duke of Portland's friends and their honourable
support.</p>

<p>Lord Beauchamp said, that as far as he understood the
intentions of Government, he approved of them&mdash;understanding
them to go to a complete derilection of the right in terms so as
not to be undone again. He entered at large into the arguments
against simple repeal; and, in answer to Fitzpatrick,
who had dwelt much on the resolution of the Houses of Parliament
as speaking the sense of the nation, in contradiction
to the Volunteer resolutions, said that he wondered to hear
such an argument from him, who took the sense of the people
of England in taverns and at clubs, &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

<p>Fitzpatrick replied to him: went over much the same
ground; defended the simple repeal; then retorted upon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
Lord Beauchamp; and took his pamphlet out of his pocket,
and reading his last sentence, that his lips should be closed
for ever upon the subject, observed that he, in his turn, was a
little surprised, after this, to hear the noble Lord's lips opened
to run a race with Government, &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

<p>I then desired to explain, that so far from saying that the
Bill was to be grounded on the insufficiency of the repeal, I
had said the direct contrary, and had stated a few days ago in
the House, my full opinion that the faith of Great Britain had
thereby been pledged to Ireland upon the avowed principle of
putting an end to every idea of legislation and jurisdiction over
that kingdom, and that nothing was implied by the present
motion which went to impeach that.</p>

<p>Fox then spoke. He went over the ground of simple repeal;
defended Grattan and his friends very warmly; and seemed to
imply pretty strongly, though he did not quite express it, that
you was to abandon&mdash;to desert those men of high integrity and
honour, whose great abilities were the smallest part of their
merit, &amp;c. It is impossible to go over the whole of what he
said; but it chiefly turned upon these heads: he said that no
Bill would do if there was not confidence; that such a system
should be adopted as to ensure this confidence, not to humiliate
the Parliament of Great Britain by bringing propositions
founded on supposed discontents, &amp;c.; that the judicature was
given up, as far as related to appeals, by the repeal of the
Declaratory Act; that writs of error were prohibited by the
Irish Act; however, a Bill might be necessary to prevent here
the exercise of a nugatory jurisdiction; but that if the preamble
of that Bill was, as had been stated by Fitzpatrick and Lord
Beauchamp, as a case to be approved of, to declare the intention,
he did not conceive how it would alter the question at all,
for if the repeal was ineffectual, it would not make it less
so, &amp;c.</p>

<p>I again got up to desire that it might be understood that I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
had not said anything which could in any way be construed
into an idea of abandoning, of deserting, &amp;c., &amp;c., men of whom
I entertained the highest opinion&mdash;men in whose integrity I
knew Government might confide with safety, and whose abilities
were, as he had said, great as they were, the least part of
their merit.</p>

<p>Mr. Percival said something about a law to try persons for
crimes committed in Ireland in England, and desired we would
attend to that, and give it up. I mean to do so. MacDonald
asked if it was meant that all idea of legislation and jurisdiction
should be given up. Townshend said, undoubtedly.</p>

<p>Pitt then closed the business with great ability. He said
that he was happy to find that, although much conversation
rather than debate had taken place, much of which he thought
superfluous, still, as to the motion and the main object of it,
the avowing in direct terms, &amp;c., &amp;c., that had been unanimously
agreed to on all sides of the House. He added, in
answer to Fox, that he trusted it would be found that the
Government was placed, both in England and in Ireland, in
the hands of persons who would not less merit the confidence,
would adopt measures not less calculated to promote the peace,
happiness and prosperity of Ireland, at the same time, with an
attention not less scrupulous to the dignity of the English
Parliament, than any other man or set of men whatever.</p>

<p>Thus ended this business, without any division or opposition,
every man having prefaced his speech with a declaration of his
intention not to oppose the motion. I cannot help thinking
that, considering all circumstances, and particularly considering
my own very delicate and awkward situation, the whole has
not gone off ill. I am impatient to receive your approbation
of Dunning's Bill. You see what Fox would say of a preamble.</p>

<p>You must not think of printing this debate, whatever you
may do with my speech; because it would not be common
justice to other people, whose speeches I have stated so very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
loosely and shortly, and it would be known for a Government
publication. I think, even for mine, you had better wait till
you get the English papers, from which it would naturally be
copied in Ireland, and then insert mine instead. Adieu.</p>

<p>Ever yours.</p>

<p>I enclose Mornington's account to Grattan.</p>

<p>In my reply to Fox I said, that so far from any desertion,
&amp;c., &amp;c., of the Duke of Portland's friends, all that was
intended was, in the expressive words of one of those gentlemen:
that as it was now necessary that Great Britain should
speak again upon the Irish subject, she should speak clearly
and openly.</p>

<p>Those are not exactly his words; but they are in his letter
to the "Trala Vol." Pray find them; for I think they describe
the transaction well.</p></div>


<p>Rumours of resignations and changes, short as the
term of the Administration had been up to this time,
were beginning to be bruited abroad. As yet there was
nothing certain: Pitt was firm, and Shelburne mysterious
as usual; but it could no longer be concealed that the
Cabinet, in addition to the dangers which threatened it
from without, was suffering in its influence from internal
dissensions.</p>


<div class="blockquot"><p>MR. W. W. GRENVILLE TO LORD TEMPLE.</p>

<p>Pall Mall, Jan. 25th, 1783.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Brother</span>,</p>

<p>The enclosed memorial of Captain Mingay describes so very
hard a case, that I could not resist sending it to you; although
the answer which I gave to the Lord Advocate, who put it into<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
my hands, was that it must come through the Commander-in-Chief.</p>

<p>Sir Charles Thompson called upon me with the memorandum
upon Sir J. Irvine. He had been ordered by the King to make
it out for Lord Shelburne, who referred him through me to
you. Upon the last paragraph, I observed that the effects were
already sold before the balance due to Government was known.
He then proposed the expedient of a temporary pension till a
Government should fall, with a provision for applying such
proportion of the income of the Government as should be
thought fit, in discharge of the debt to the public account.</p>

<p>Bulkeley spoke to me yesterday from Lord Northington,
about Lady Ligonier. I desired him to advise Lord Northington,
as from himself, to write to you about it. If you should
then think you can do anything in it, which I cannot help
hoping, the obligation will lay upon Lord Northington and not
upon Bulkeley.</p>

<p>Lord Clermont called upon me yesterday. He put in his
claim to the Order, to which I gave the answer of non-residence.
He said that he was always over in the Parliamentary winter,
and had a house and establishment both in Dublin and in the
country. I promised to write to you upon it, but gave him
little encouragement, nor indeed did he press it much. Townshend
tells me the King makes no difficulty about the <i>cordon
bleu</i>, which of course you will magnify as infinitely more
honourable, &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

<p>The Post-Office here have been making a strange jumble,
and have drawn up a most extravagant Act, God knows why,
which they sent to Lord Clermont; I enclose it to you, with
my answer to him. We shall be devilishly pressed in the
House of Commons about our settlement, as the argument of
war is at an end; and yet I doubt whether the people here
have either leisure or knowledge sufficient even to talk about it
yet. The latter I am sure I have not; and even if I had,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
I should not think it wise to set the head of every Irish
projector here and with you, perfectly afloat. In the meantime
it will be matter of some difficulty to parry it.</p>

<p>Did I state to you in my account of the debate, Percival's
question about the Act of Henry VIII., under which offences
committed in the King's dominions beyond seas are triable in
England? I rather think the answer will be, both to that and
to what I think Lord Beauchamp will probably move, namely,
a repeal of all English Acts, as far as they affect Ireland; that
they fall to the ground themselves, except where confirmed by
Irish Acts; but that if they were repealed, a question might
arise how far even those would continue in force, according to
Yelverton's Bill.</p>

<p>Ever yours,<br/>
W. W. G.</p>

<p>P.S.&mdash;Yesterday, after making eighteen post-captains the
day before, and after having attended the Cabinet in which the
preliminaries were signed, Lord Keppel resigned the Admiralty.
There are two ideas upon this; one is that he had always
intended it as soon as peace was concluded, the other that he
disapproved the articles. I think they are very consistent, and
that if he had the first intention, he would take care to lay
a groundwork for future opposition by refusing his concurrence
to the peace; besides which, he probably feels little disposed
to any mode of bringing about an event by which he loses
so much consequence, and what is no less dear to him, so much
patronage. I hear nothing said from any authority about his
successor; the Duke of Grafton and Lord Howe seem to be the
persons most talked of. Things are going on much too well
in Ireland for them to think of, or I think for you to wish,
especially at this moment, a different arrangement from either
of those two.</p>

<p>It is very much reported, and I believe with certainty, that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
the Duke of Richmond has retired from the Cabinet, and
means at the same time to keep the Ordnance. What other
people mean about that, is, I think, not quite so clear; though
the Duke of Richmond's bitterest enemy could not, I should
think, wish to see him in a more degrading situation&mdash;such
a situation, indeed, as it seems impossible should last for any
length of time, or a moment longer than till a proper successor
is found.</p>

<p>Minorca goes to France, and not to Spain, as Tom told you.
That, I think, is <i>tant pis</i>.</p>

<p>I have just received your despatches of the 22nd, and found,
to my great disappointment, that you had not then received
mine of the 19th. It is upon the conviction of <i>bonne foi</i> that
I act.</p>

<p>Ever yours,<br/>
W. W. G.</p>

<p>I hope if the Admiralty should be offered you, you
deliberate very maturely, particularly on the prospect in the
House of Commons here.</p></div>


<div class="blockquot"><p>MR. W. W. GRENVILLE TO LORD TEMPLE.</p>

<p>Pall Mall, Jan. 27th, 1783.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Brother</span>,</p>

<p>Although Townshend has probably informed you, yet I could
not help writing a line by this messenger to congratulate you
upon the capture of a French seventy-four and frigate, with
which the war ends. They were taken near Barbadoes, by
Hughes's squadron, after a short action with the 'Ruby,' the
headmost ship.</p>

<p>I have already written by the post. The Duke of Richmond's
resignation is not certain; and Townshend, Conway
and Pitt certainly approve and stay in.</p>

<p>Ever yours,<br/>

<p>Some particulars concerning the arrangements for the
new Order of Knighthood will be read with curiosity.
The pretensions of particular individuals to the Ribband
of St. Patrick do not properly form materials for political
history, and a few letters, in which such claims are freely
canvassed, have been excluded from our selection. But
the following, which touches upon the small preliminaries
to which statesmen are forced to condescend on these
ceremonial occasions, possesses more general interest of
an illustrative kind.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>MR. W. W. GRENVILLE TO LORD TEMPLE.</p>

<p>Pall Mall, Jan. 31st, 1783.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Brother</span>,</p>

<p>While you are persecuted by Lords Arran, Aldborough,
Altamnt, and <i>omne quod incipit</i> in A, I have had daily application
from Lord Clermont, which I have promised to submit
formally to you.</p>

<p>His family and connexions in Ireland and their weight is the
first thing he states. To this I gave the answer of non-residence.
He says that he always resides during the Parliament
winter; that he has a house and establishment both in Dublin
and in the country; and that he is more a resident than Lord
Clanricarde or Lord Courtown. I then stated the impossibility
of increasing the number, which had been a particular object
with the King. His solution to that was, that when the King
named sixteen, he certainly did not mean to include himself;
and that the Thistle is twelve without the Sovereign. He
proposes therefore that, as he has always been one of those
talked of for it, and <i>as his friends make it</i> a point with him to
apply, you should make it sixteen without the King, by adding
his name.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span></p>

<p>You will therefore be so good as either to send him from
yourself, or to commission me to write to him, a formal answer,
<i>tel qu'il vous plaira</i>.</p>

<p>In general, the list is approved; but they object to the
insertion of Lord Bechoe's name, and to the omission of Lord
Meath's.</p>

<p>Fox and his people are very industrious in turning it into
ridicule, by which I should think they would not increase their
Irish popularity. And what is ridiculous, is that at the same
time the Duke of Portland is taking pains to persuade all
Irishmen that he meant to have done the same if he had staid
long enough.</p>

<p>I have seen Edmonson, who has this day given me in a
proposal, which you will not think much more moderate than
you did his bill for the escutcheons (which, by the bye, he
says you have never paid).</p>

<p>I should think the twenty guineas per Knight for the superintendence
might very well be reduced to giving him <i>pro
tempore</i>, and for this installation only, one of the heralds'
places, in lieu of all travelling expenses and allowances. The
Painters' Bill, as they call it, is fixed for the Bath, and might,
I should think, reasonably be given to him at the same
rate.</p>

<p>He is making out copies of the drawings; one or two
alterations he has suggested which strike me. The first is the
knots in the Collar. If they are gold, and the harp likewise,
the whole will look, I think, too like a Lord Mayor's gold
chain, and will make no show; nothing being more dull to
the eye than plain gold. He wants to have them enamelled, so
as to be like the strings and tassels of the mantle.</p>

<p>He will also send a drawing of the Badge, with the wreath of
trefoil drawn in single leaves, instead of the full wreath, which
looks, as he says truly, like a civic crown or oak garland. But
this you will see in the drawing, and which looks best.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span></p>

<p>I wish that there was a statute to fix the plates of the
Knights to remain in the stall in which they were first installed.
In the chapel at Windsor they are obliged now to put them
up loose, in order to their being removed; the consequence is,
that they are frequently lost. Besides, the plates of the first
sixteen might then be fixed in the centre of each stall as a mark
of distinction for the founders.</p>

<p>In the Garter there are no plates in the Sovereign's stall. I
should think that the Grand Master at each installation might
be allowed to put up his, as the banner must of course always
be the Sovereign's.</p>

<p>Edmonson proposes that he should have one of each article of
the Painters' Bill made here, to carry with him as a pattern.
If you see no objection, he might do Mornington's for this
purpose. An advantage might be given to Edmonson by
authorizing him to publish an account of the ceremony, with
the arms and pedigrees of the Knights, &amp;c., &amp;c., to which they
would of course subscribe.</p>

<p>Is the jewellery&mdash;I mean collars and badges&mdash;to be done in
Ireland? I believe there is no workmanship at all of that sort
there.</p>

<p>Townshend will, I believe, send the approbation to-night.
It has waited upon an idea of the Prince of Wales, who gave it
out to everybody that he had sent in to the King to ask for it.<a name="FNanchor_1_4" id="FNanchor_1_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_4" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
This was the day after the King had given his approbation to
the list, and named Prince Edward. I thought it right to wait
a day or two, to know if the King would speak to him about
it. He never has; and Townshend is to mention the Order
again to-day, and send the approbation to night or to-morrow.
Adieu.</p>

<p>Ever yours,<br/>
W. W. G.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_4" id="Footnote_1_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_4"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> The Premier did ask for it, but was refused.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span></p></div>

<p>The "Coalition Administration" was now beginning
to "loom" dimly in the distance. Various changes were
whispered, and from day to day new reports got abroad
of negotiations with Lord North's party. The first step
towards the consummation of an alliance may be said to
have been already taken when Townshend, abandoning
the traditions of his party, told Mr. Grenville that he saw
no reason for proscribing all Lord North's people from
<i>office</i>, although he objected to giving them any share in
the <i>Government</i>. The meaning of this ingenious distinction
is clear. The Administration was tottering, and
the only chance they saw of strengthening their position
was to buy off the opposition of the followers of the late
Cabinet. To swamp their opponents and at the same
time keep the actual power in their own hands, was
a piece of strategy which might be expected from the
general character of Lord Shelburne's tactics. But it
failed, and failed conspicuously. Mr. Grenville discerned
clearly the danger of this clever plan, from which he could
anticipate no other result than that of sapping the foundations
of the existing Government. In the letters that
follow we have a close running commentary on the state of
parties, and the rumours that hourly agitated the public
mind during this interval of intestine struggle. Mr. Grenville
considered the circumstances of the Ministry hopeless,
as, we gather from his previous communications, he
appears to have done all throughout. Their conduct
upon the Irish Bill, which was still destined to entail
division and uneasiness, revealed to him the fatal want of
unity, earnestness and activity in their councils; and even<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
if they had had no perils to guard against from without,
he saw sources of weakness enough within the Cabinet
itself to destroy all confidence in their stability. There
were only two parties from whose ranks the Ministry
could be recruited, and these two had hitherto acted
in public life with the fiercest animosity towards each other.
The attempts that were made to win over some of
Lord North's adherents having failed, the only alternative
left was to apply to Fox. That this application was
actually made, and made in person by Pitt, who, with a
thorough knowledge of the character of Fox, believed that
the most direct mode of ascertaining his sentiments was
not only the most honourable to both, but the most likely
to attain its end, either by a candid refusal or immediate
acceptance, is here authoritatively stated by Mr. Grenville.
Fox's answer is conclusive as to the real obstacle
which impeded all negotiation. While Lord Shelburne
was in office nothing could be done: no party would
consent to coalesce with him. The humiliating condition
to which he had lowered the Administration, is
shown in the straits to which it was now reduced&mdash;seeking
support alternately from opposite parties, and
finding its offers rejected in turn by both.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>MR. W. W. GRENVILLE TO LORD TEMPLE.</p>

<p>Pall Mall, Feb. 6th, 1783.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Brother</span>,</p>

<p>Townshend's messenger is nowhere, waiting for this letter;
and as, by a mistake, I was not till now informed of his going
to-night, I have only time to write a few lines, just to acknowledge<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
the receipt of your letter of the 2nd instant, and to say a
very little upon the singular situation of things here.</p>

<p>To-day, when I delivered your despatches to Townshend, I
entered into a conversation with him on this subject, saying
that you trusted to him for information, &amp;c., &amp;c. He perfectly
agreed with me in thinking that it could not go on without
some new arrangement of some sort or other. At the same
time, he said that he knew of no negotiation going on with
Lord North. That there was no truth in the reports which
have circulated so much that Jenkinson was to be Chancellor
of the Exchequer, Pitt Secretary, and himself Paymaster. That
he had good reason to believe that there had been a negotiation
between Lord North and Fox, but that it was now off. That,
for his own part, he saw no reason for proscribing all Lord
North's people from <i>office</i>, but he should not like to see them in
<i>Government</i>.</p>

<p>Upon this text it is not very easy to reason. The prevailing
idea certainly is that Lord Shelburne is making overtures to
Lord North. Whether those are to go to Cabinet arrangement,
or only to provision for Lord North's family and offices
of emolument, &amp;c., for George North, &amp;c., &amp;c., I do not know;
if the former, it is clear that he keeps it from the knowledge
both of Townshend and Pitt; the latter, I have very good
reason to believe, would object to it.</p>

<p>In the meantime a storm is brewing, and will probably burst
when the preliminaries come to be considered, unless some
event takes place before that time. Lord Keppel and the Duke
of Richmond both assign the badness of the peace for their
reason for resigning. Lord Carlisle does the same, but I
understand his great objection goes to the Loyalists, to whom
he considered his personal honour engaged. The report of the
day is, that the Duke of Grafton has followed their example.
Of this Townshend said not one word to me, nor did I hear it
till after I had seen him. This rather makes me disinclined to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
believe it, though his Grace has certainly had a kind of flirtation
with Fox for some days past.</p>

<p>Upon the whole, the only thing which I can at all venture to
pronounce with certainty, is that it cannot do as it is; and that
if Fox's people continue, as I believe they will, to stand aloof,
they must either all resign, or fill up the vacancies as fast as
they occur, day after day, with Lord North's people. <i>En quo
discordia cives prodaxit miseros.</i></p>

<p>In the case of an immediate resignation, Lord North's people
will come in by storm (Fox not having the least chance): in
that of gradual admission, they will sap the Government by
degrees. In either case, there is too much reason to fear the
return of the old system of corruption on one side, and faction
on the other.</p>

<p>With regard to the peace, I own I cannot think it so bad,
all things considered. If one measures it by an <i>uti possidetis</i>,
it is surely advantageous; and I see no reason for being at all
confident that another campaign would have put us in a better
situation to negotiate. In this line, I had intended to have
stated my ideas on the day of debate in the House of Commons;
but I am deterred by reading your opinions, and by
a fear, I believe too well grounded, that you will take an active
part the other way; and I cannot reconcile myself to the
appearance of a Scotch family. If it had not been for this,
I think it would have had a handsome appearance in the hour
of their distress, and would not have had a bad effect in
Ireland; if, indeed, we are any longer interested there, which
I begin to doubt. Adieu, my dearest brother.</p>

<p>Ever most affectionately yours,<br/>

<div class="blockquot"><p>MR. W. W. GRENVILLE TO LORD TEMPLE.</p>

<p>Pall Mall, Feb. 8th, 1783, Nine, <span class="smcap">P.M.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Brother</span>,</p>

<p>I wrote to you this morning an account, which you will
receive at the same time with this letter, of a conversation
with Lord Bellamont. I little thought, at that time, that I
should now have one of so different a nature to detail to you,
which I had, just before dinner, with Percy. He said, that
although he might be thought officious in coming to speak to
me upon a subject, upon which it had not been thought proper
to make him any communication, yet he could not help saying
that he thought it inconsistent with his duty to you, &amp;c., &amp;c.,
not to state to me that he had last night procured from the
House of Commons a copy of the Bill proposed; and that he
was fully convinced that, so far from answering the purpose
intended by it, the country would be thrown by it into a much
greater flame than ever. I asked him to state his objections;
he said they would be best seen by the form which he had
drawn up, and would leave with me for my consideration.</p>

<p>I did not detail to him the many objections which occur to
me upon his Bill, and particularly that most insuperable difficulty
of its asserting what the right now is, in contradiction to
the declared opinion of almost every lawyer in this country.
But I said, in general terms, that the Bill in question had
been drawn up with great consideration; and that it was a
matter of infinite delicacy, on account of the great variety of
prejudices to be encountered on both sides of the water. He
asked if this was the form which had been sent to you, and if
you had consulted people there upon it. To this I could not
but answer that I understood you had, though you do not say
a word to me upon that subject, and it is a question which will
most certainly be asked in the House of Commons.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span></p>

<p>This unexpected difficulty has made me determine to postpone
the second reading of the Bill till I have an answer to
this letter, unless I should in the meantime receive one from
you perfectly approving, and stating the opinions of people in
Ireland as agreeing with yours upon it.</p>

<p>It is certainly to be observed, that the whole of this difficulty
has arisen from want of communication from Ministry
to you. Because, if you had known that they were determined
to admit no recognition of the existing right, it would have
been well worth considering whether anything short of that
would not be worse than as it was before. Instead of that,
they receive your resolutions and your Bill, and then pledge
themselves, and suffer me to pledge both them and you to
<i>a Bill</i>; after which, they first say that they will allow of
nothing which admits the <i>original</i> right, and when beat from
that ground, that they will not have anything asserting the
<i>present</i> right. It then only remained, as we were pledged to
<i>a Bill</i>, to consider whether this was not the best form of a
Bill to be drawn on such principles.</p>

<p>Whatever your answer has been to Townshend's despatch, I
hope at least that it has been coolly and temperately expressed,
as he told me he meant to represent to you that an advantage
had been taken against you from the warmth of your late
despatches.</p>

<p>Another advantage which will arise from deferring the
second reading will be, that by that time this strange, unsettled
situation of things must have taken some form; and I do not
believe that this form will be such as you will choose to act
under in Ireland. In that case, it certainly will not be worth
our while to engage our characters to a measure which the folly
of your successor may render pernicious; which must at all
events be precarious; and which England will most certainly
repent whenever the hour of her insolence shall return. We
took the business out of the hands of Lord Beauchamp, because<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
it ought to be conducted by Government; and that will be the
best reason for resigning it into other hands whenever we
shall cease to stand in that character; which <i>whenever</i> must, I
think, arrive in the course of a very few days.</p>

<p>Jemmy is to dine at Lord Shelburne's on Monday, when he
will probably be able to tell you more. I go to Townshend
to-morrow, and mean to try what I can get from him.</p>

<p>At least we have the satisfaction to reflect, that if your reign
has been short, it has not been dishonourable to you; and that
having taken the Government at a most difficult and inauspicious
moment, you will quit it with more real and more
deserved popularity than the Duke of Portland, notwithstanding
the uncommon advantages which threw themselves in his
way.</p>

<p>Of myself I say nothing, except that wherever and whatever
I am, I shall always consider myself as deriving honour, consequence
and happiness from your character and success.</p>

<p>In these sentiments believe me,<br/>
My dearest brother,<br/>
Ever most affectionately yours,<br/>
W. W. G.</p>

<p>I am able to tell you nothing with any certainty as to the
state of parties; but I think that neither Lord Shelburne nor
Fox are strong enough to keep the Government without a
coalition with Lord North's people, and that the latter are too
strong to sell themselves unless they be admitted to form part
of the <i>Government</i>. Fox's people no longer deny his negotiating
with Lord North.</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>MR. W. W. GRENVILLE TO LORD TEMPLE.</p>

<p>Pall Mall, Feb. 8th, 1783.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Brother</span>,</p>

<p>Lord Nugent tells me that when he saw the Primate, he
observed to him that, by the list of officers of the Order, there
was no mention made of any prelate, although in other respects
the Garter was implicitly followed; and he says he thought, by
the Primate's manner, that he himself wanted to be that
prelate; as that officer is, you know, superior in rank to the
Chancellor of the Order.</p>

<p>If this be the case, I can see no reason why the offer should
not be made to him, which might still be done by your writing
to say that that office had been omitted, from the impossibility
of giving it to any other person but himself, and a doubt how
far he might like the trouble; but that you had daily expected
him in Ireland, and meant to ask him the question; but the
time now drawing near, &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

<p>Nothing else has passed on the subject, except a third application
from Lord Clermont, through General Cuninghame, to
whom I stated the total impossibility, &amp;c. I expected Lord
Bellamont to have asked it to-day; but he did not drop a word
upon the subject.</p>

<p>Ever yours,<br/>
W. W. G.</p></div>


<div class="blockquot"><p>MR. W. W. GRENVILLE TO LORD TEMPLE.</p>

<p>Feb. 11th, 1783.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Brother</span>,</p>

<p>Things are drawing near to their crisis. Lord Shelburne's
weakness is every day more apparent. Nothing is clearer than
that he cannot stand a week without some addition. The
strongest proof of this is what Pitt told me to-day: that it
being thought necessary to make some attempt at a junction<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
with Fox, he had seen him to-day, when he asked one question,
viz., whether there were any terms on which he would come in.
The answer was, None, while Lord Shelburne remained; and
so it ended.</p>

<p>Upon this, I think one may observe, that the one must be
very desperate, the other very confident, before such a question
could be so put and so answered.</p>

<p>I told him I was glad the attempt was made, though I was
not at all surprised at the event. He said that he thought
they would now be justified in seeking for additional strength
elsewhere. I said I thought so too, but that I could not help
trusting that this expression did not go to include the idea of
bringing back any of the old people <i>to Cabinet offices</i>; that I
thought the line was clear that it was the duty of every man to
do his utmost to keep the Government in such hands as were fit
and able to hold it (under which description I could not include
any of that set); but that when it was so placed, it was idle to
say that support was not to be looked for where it could be had.
He said that, without making professions, he could with truth
say, that this had always been his idea. And so our conversation
ended&mdash;at least, this was the only material part
of it.</p>

<p>There is no doubt but that they have been making proposals
to Jenkinson, and these must have failed before the other offer
could be made. On the other hand, I know for certain that
negotiations, <i>through more than one channel</i>, have been <i>entam&eacute;</i>
between Fox and Lord North. This must be <i>bien en train</i>, if
one may judge by what I tell you in this letter.</p>

<p>In that case, as well as in that which I put to &mdash;&mdash;, I take
it for granted that I know your line; and whatever the effect
of that line must be with respect to my own fortunes, I have
infinitely too great a concern for your honour and my own, not
to desire and wish it most eagerly. The only thing which
pains me is the consideration of Bernard. If the interval<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
should afford you an opportunity for that, I should depart in
peace. Adieu.</p>

<p>Believe me,<br/>
Most sincerely and affectionately yours,<br/>
&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p></div>


<div class="blockquot"><p>MR. W. W. GRENVILLE TO LORD TEMPLE.</p>

<p>Pall Mall, Feb. 15th, 1783.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Brother</span>,</p>

<p>I have this day received your letter of the 9th, and have the
greatest satisfaction at that which you express respecting this
long-agitated Bill. Since you wrote that, but before this time,
you will have received a letter from me, enclosing a Bill
proposed by Percy. I confess his dissent alarmed me a good
deal at the time, ignorant as I was whether you might not see
it in the same light. I am convinced now that it proceeds only
from his resentment at not being consulted previous to its
being fixed upon. The second reading stands now for Wednesday;
but I doubt whether it can come on, as I understand the
call previously fixed for that day is to be insisted upon.
Before that time, I shall probably have received your letter,
informing me whom you have consulted, as that is very
material, particularly with regard to my being able to urge
Grattan and Yelverton's authority against Fox and Fitzpatrick.
At all events, however, I mean now to proceed in it on that
day if I can, if not as early as possible, and to <i>bring</i> you the
account of the third reading in the House of Commons.</p>

<p>All this proceeds upon the idea that nothing of a different
nature happens before; which I still think there is every
reason to imagine. I cannot learn whether Fox and Lord
North have settled their coalition so as to act together on
Monday. Jenkinson is, I believe, secured to us; but at what
price, and with what following, I am utterly ignorant; and on
that the whole undoubtedly depends. As soon as I know<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
anything, you shall hear it in the most expeditious manner;
but I do not give you my conjectures when they are merely
such, because I know people at a distance are apt to give them
more weight than they deserve, and I should be sorry to
mislead you.</p>

<p>The Duke of Rutland is Lord Steward, and it is said he is
called to the Cabinet. This, to my mind, argues great weakness
indeed. In the House of Lords, Lord Pembroke moves the
Address; in the House of Commons, T. Pitt. This, I think,
does not show very great strength. The seconders I know not.</p>

<p>You have several times mentioned the Pension List; and I
have as often forgot to tell you, that I inquired in the first
instance without speaking to Pitt, and found that, whatever
reform is to be made, rests wholly with Lord Shelburne, who
appears to act in it on no system, but to add or to take away
at his pleasure. Jackson and Jemmy Grenville remonstrated
some days ago at the Treasury against signing any more till
they saw that the act was to be complied with.</p>

<p>Upon the subject of the Fisheries, I have had a conversation
with Hunter Blair, the member for Edinburgh. There has
been a meeting of the Scotch members to support a Bill in
Parliament to extend the bounty now given in England for the
Scotch coast, to fish caught on the Irish coast, and to give the
fishermen a power of landing and drying on the Irish, as on
the Scotch coast. They went to Lord Shelburne, who referred
them to me. I desired Blair to send me a copy of the memorial,
and an abstract of the several British and Irish Acts on
the subject.</p>

<p>The Irish are very ill done, as the two most material, in
1764 and 1776, are omitted. I do not find by any Irish Act
whether the Irish fishermen have the power of landing and
drying; if they have, I should think it <i>does</i> extend to all the
King's subjects; as the Act of 1782, restraining the <i>bounty</i> to
Irish ships, does not touch the power of fishing. If they have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
it not, no English Act now to be made can give it them; but
if they have it, we may extend the bounty as we please.</p>

<p>The reason they assign for wishing it is, that the herrings
shift yearly from one part to another of the narrow seas, and
that as the Irish have, by an English Act, the privilege of
fishing on the Scotch coast, it is but just that the English and
Scotch should fish on the Irish when the fish are there, as has
been the case these two last years. The consideration presses,
as the seamen now to be discharged will, of course, many of
them return to Scotland to find employment, and the fishing
cannot, as they state, be carried on at all, but by such indulgence
as they apply for.</p>

<p>Lord Glandon was with me to-day, to ask whether Coppinger
is one of the new Judges, and, in that case, who he
should bring in for his borough. He told me that he had sold
the other seat to Sir W. Gleadowe. I did not dare ask whether
he was engaged for the next Parliament, because it would have
given too much of a hint of the dissolution. I therefore only
said, that I did not believe the names were fixed for the three
Judges.</p>

<p>Lord Bellamont is outrageous about the Order, and has been
<i>with Townshend</i> about it; but not with me. I have sent your
paper about Irvine to Lord Shelburne, but have had no answer.
I enclose you a letter from Lord Clanricarde, with my answer.
Lord Nugent has seen him, and says he is beyond measure
flattered, and well-disposed towards you.</p>

<p>I shall go to Lord Shelburne on Tuesday or Wednesday, and
press him about the peerages, &amp;c., &amp;c. As to applying to
Townshend, it is useless; for he has all the disposition in the
world, but not a jot more.</p>

<p>I own I think the 18th of March will be rather too soon
after the installation, and will look too like a trick, and too
much in the style of the St. Bartholemi: and yet, if you wait
much longer, you will fall among their cursed assizes; besides<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
which, new grounds for tests will spring up, whereas there are
now none, absolutely none.</p>

<p>Adieu, my dear brother,<br/>
Believe me, ever most affectionately yours,<br/>
W. W. G.</p>

<p>I think our distant projects for the Government of Ireland,
are something like Horace Walpole's "Butterfly and Rose."</p>

<p>Hester is as well as possible.</p>

<p>Pray be on your guard, as I have great reason to believe
that your conduct is watched, and your language and conversation
reported to Fox, by a man about the Castle, who keeps up
a constant correspondence in that quarter. I need not name
him to you.</p></div>


<p>On the 17th of February, the terms of the peace were
brought under the consideration of both Houses of Parliament.
To do Lord Shelburne justice, he defended
them with considerable ability, as being the best the
country had a right to expect, or, probably, could obtain.
In the Lords, the Address was carried by an insignificant
majority: in the Commons, Ministers were defeated. As
it was upon the negotiation and settlement of the peace
that Lord Shelburne had solely relied all along for the
preservation of his Government, the effect of this defeat
was decisive. It was the doom of the Ministry; and the
bolt was launched by that strange combination which had
been growing up in secret for several weeks, which was
now openly avowed for the first time, and which was too
powerful to be resisted. The coalition had, in fact, already
been determined upon. Fox frankly stated it, and supported
the Amendment, conjointly with Lord North, in a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
speech of considerable force and vehemence. However
the House might have been prepared by the rumours
of the day for this result, it excited universal surprise,
and not a little virtuous indignation. Mr. Powis observed
that, it was "an age of strange confederations; a <i>monstrous
coalition</i> had taken place between a noble Lord
and an illustrious commoner&mdash;the lofty asserter of the
prerogative had joined in an alliance with the worshippers
of the majesty of the people." Such words had more
purpose and meaning in those days than they would have
in our own, and the startling antithesis rang through a
debate as remarkable for invective on the one side, as for
the confession of weakness on the other. Mr. Grenville
and Lord Bulkeley communicated the issue to Lord
Temple, in the following hasty notes.</p>


<div class="blockquot"><p>MR. W. W. GRENVILLE TO LORD TEMPLE.</p>

<p>Feb. 18th, 1783, Ten, <span class="smcap">A.M.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Brother</span>,</p>

<p>I write these few lines by a messenger, to let you know that
this morning, at seven o'clock, after a debate of fifteen hours,
the House of Commons divided: 209 for the original Address
upon the peace, and 224 for the Amendment.</p>

<p>The Address was very cautiously worded, and by no means
conveyed any strong approbation. The Amendment was
merely to assure His Majesty that we <i>will</i> consider the preliminaries,
and in the meantime we consider ourselves bound
strictly to adhere to the articles to which, by the ratification,
the national faith is pledged; with something about the
loyalists.</p>

<p>The Address was moved and seconded by T. Pitt and Wilberforce;
the Amendment, by Lord John Cavendish and St.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
Andrew St. John. Lord North spoke next to them, in approbation
of it. Fox avowed the coalition with Lord North,
and was a good deal attacked upon it, particularly by Powis.
Tom, to my infinite joy, did not speak. Jemmy spoke. Rigby
spoke and voted with us.</p>

<p>In the House of Lords, the Amendment was a strong
censure: this was rejected, 69 to 55.</p>

<p>Where this is to end, God knows! <i>Je n'en scai rien.</i> I
am too much fatigued to be able to give you any particulars of
the debate. Adieu.</p>

<p>Ever yours,<br/>
W. W. G.</p></div>


<div class="blockquot"><p>LORD BULKELEY TO LORD TEMPLE.</p>

<p>Berkeley Square,</p>

<p>Tuesday Night, Feb. 18th, 1783.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Lord Temple</span>,</p>

<p>I conclude your brother William, and Jemmy Grenville,
have given you exact accounts of the strange politics of the
present moment. By a junction formed between Lord North
and Fox, on Sunday evening last, the Address in our House
was not carried; but the Amendment was, 224 to 208. The
landed property was mostly with Government, and for the
Address. There were, however, many country gentlemen for
the Amendment; and among the rest, Sir William Williams.
My good father-in-law voted in the majority, as a small return
for my bringing him into Parliament, and he is patted on the
back by George Byng, Plummer, &amp;c., for the <i>noble, disinterested
part</i> he takes, while I am looked upon as a black
sheep; of which I console myself, and have reason to console
myself, when I see the views and motives of some great
political characters to be so profligate and abandoned. Lord
North and Charles Fox acting together in public life, is a new
and extraordinary scene! Many people say it was only for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
last night; but I believe the arrangement has completely taken
place, and the overthrow of the present Ministry is consequently
certain. The Amendment in the Lords was very
strong, and full of censure, and was negatived only by 14;
the numbers being, 69 to 55.</p>

<p>I cannot conceive it possible the Ministry can stand three
days longer; I must therefore hope, whatever line you adopt,
it may be upon the maturest reflection and deliberation, and
not in a hurry. The new Ministry, if they can agree, will be
very powerful in Parliament. At the same time, there are
great numbers of members who are outrageous at the junction
of Fox with Lord North, who, it is said, is to have all his
friends provided for, to advance to the House of Peers, and to
leave the Government to Charles Fox, Duke of Portland, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Sincerely yours,<br/>
<span class="smcap">Bulkeley</span>.</p>

<p>The Primate proposed the prelateship to me. I will therefore
call there to offer it in your name.</p></div>


<p>The next letter, written on the 19th, is very important.
Mr. Grenville here collects the actual circumstances affecting
the state of parties from the most authentic sources,
and places them before Lord Temple for his consideration,
in reference to the course he might deem it due to his
own honour to take. We learn, from this statement,
that the coalition was not yet finally arranged, although
it had been carried into effective execution, as against the
Ministry. It had been sufficiently cemented for the
purpose of overthrowing one Government, but was not
yet sufficiently consolidated for the establishment of
another. It was one thing for Lord North and Fox
to agree in their opposition to Lord Shelburne, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
another to unite upon the distribution of offices and a
distinct line of policy. There were yet many old wounds
to be healed, many differences of opinion to be reconciled,
and much personal asperity to be soothed, before Fox and
Lord North could satisfy the claims and resentments of
their adherents, and combine in the formation of a
Government. We learn also from this letter, that the
King was strenuous in his support of Lord Shelburne
(which had been obvious enough all throughout), and
that he had now prevailed upon him, as he had before
done with Lord North, to persevere in the face of the
desperate phalanx that was arrayed against him. Government
trusted to the divisions which were understood to be
agitating the new Opposition, and which it was hoped
would ultimately lead to its dissolution.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>MR. W. W. GRENVILLE TO LORD TEMPLE.</p>

<p>Pall Mall, Feb. 19th, 1783.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Brother</span>,</p>

<p>I wrote to you yesterday morning by a messenger, in order
that you might receive the earliest information of the event of
our decision. I was then infinitely too much harassed by the
fatigue and want of sleep to attempt entering into the detail of
the debate, being indeed scarcely able to hold my pen at all.
You will since have seen it at length in the papers. I therefore
say nothing upon that subject.</p>

<p>I have since at several different times sat down to write to
you fully upon the situation of things here, and upon your
letter of the 11th, which I received last night. But I find it so
difficult to offer any reasonable conjecture upon the probable
event, and things have taken so different a turn from that
which you supposed, and on which you argue, that I have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
thought it better to confine myself to the following facts (being
all I know) on the authenticity of which you may depend.
From them you will yourself collect the different circumstances
which may occur, upon which you will be [enabled] to form a
decision very material to your future character, honour, and
happiness. If any of these should take place before I hear
from you again, you may depend on the earliest notice which I
can give you.</p>

<p>In the first place, Lord Shelburne never has made any offer
whatever to Lord North.</p>

<p>Secondly, the coalition between Lord North and Fox is very
far from being formed; so far indeed, that <i>I know</i> they have
differed, not only on loaves and fishes, but on the subject of
high and responsible office, and particularly about the Treasury
itself, which was not settled this morning.</p>

<p>Thirdly, the King is decidedly with Lord Shelburne. His
opinion of Fox I apprehend not to be altered, nor his former
resentment against Lord North much softened by their present
conduct. Rigby and Jenkinson both voted with us: the latter
avowedly excluded from the proposed arrangement.</p>

<p>Fourthly, it is the intention of Ministry to wait the event of
another question in the House of Commons. The subject is to
be resumed on Friday, when this question will probably occur.
And this they do in compliance with the &mdash;&mdash;'s wishes. The
Duke of Grafton totters, but has not actually resigned.</p>

<p>The division was very respectable on our side. Almost all
the country gentlemen voted with us. Many of them are
outrageous with Fox upon the idea of his coalition. Lord
North's share of the 224 is computed from 160 to 170.</p>

<p>Our Bill was read a second time to-day, but so early, that I
was not down. Percival asked some question about his idea;
you have never said anything to me upon it. It is committed
for this day sev'nnight; before that time, chaos will probably
have taken some form; in the meantime I cannot but fear the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
most serious and alarming consequences from the impression
which this division must make in France, Spain, and above all,
in Holland.</p>

<p>Pray write as soon as you can, and believe me<br/>
Most sincerely and affectionately yours,<br/>
W. W. G.</p>

<p>P.S. I shall see the Speaker to-morrow.</p>

<p>I have delayed writing this so long, that I find it is too late
to send it by the post, and it is not I think worth an express.
I will therefore keep it for your tailor, who goes to-morrow,
and tells me he rides post. If so, you will get it sooner; and
if anything should occur before to-morrow evening, I shall be
able to state it.</p>

<p>20th.</p>

<p>I hear nothing new to-day. Lord J. Cavendish moves tomorrow,
and is supposed to intend censure. If so, we shall
very probably see the new alliance divided, especially if their
differences continue, which I know not. I have not seen Percy,
but shall to-morrow; I called to-day, but he was out.</p>

<p>Lord Beauchamp says he will not oppose our Bill; nor,
I imagine, in this state of things, will Fox. I need not say
that at this moment no business goes on, and consequently
it is in vain to talk to them about the different points in your
despatches.</p></div>

</div></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Adieu, my dear brother, you shall hear from me again on
Saturday morning; but in the meantime pray let me hear from
you as soon as you can.</p>

<p>Ever yours,<br/>
W. W. G.</p>

<p>I just hear that the Duke of Grafton has resigned.</p></div>

<p>The King, who was not expected in town till the 19th,
came up suddenly on the 18th, immediately on the receipt<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
of the intelligence of the Ministerial defeat. On the 20th,
General Cuninghame, writing to Lord Temple, informs
him that the Duke of Grafton had resigned the day before,
having intimated his intention to do so on the preceding
Monday; that he had just learned that Mr. Fox and Lord
North had adjusted their differences; and that the outline
of an Administration had been actually agreed upon&mdash;the
Devonshires to have the Treasury, probably in the person of
the Duke of Portland, and Fox, Chancellor of the Exchequer.
"The political world," adds General Cuninghame,
"is in a ferment, and a few days must decide the complexion
of a new Administration. Every one hopes and
believes it will be on a broad bottom; and your Excellency
will probably be at liberty to choose your situation." On
the next day, the same correspondent announces that Lord
Shelburne "is determined to stand the thunder of the
House of Commons," on a resolution which was to be
brought forward that night, to show that the peace was inadequate.
He goes on to state that the issue of the debate
was doubtful, and that Lord Shelburne was by no means
disposed to give up without a struggle. "If the Opposition
should be beat from there not being sufficient evidence
before them, an inquiry will be instituted. No man at
this hour pretends to say how the question will be decided.
One may get a beat [bet?] of hundreds at either side.
So many difficulties arise in arranging a new Administration,
that I now understand Lord Shelburne will not easily
yield his pretensions." In the few hours that elapsed
since he had written the former letter, General Cuninghame
had reason to doubt the correctness of his information
respecting the validity of the agreement amongst the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
opponents of Government. "I now doubt," he observes,
"very much of the possibility of arranging Mr. Fox's and
Lord North's friends in such a manner as to make their
system carry the appearance of permanency." The
inconstancy of the reports in circulation reflected faithfully
the uncertainty that hung over the action of all
parties; and in that uncertainty lay the principal, perhaps
the only, ground of hope that was left to Lord Shelburne.</p>

<p>That the negotiations in the meanwhile for a coalition
had advanced to something like an intelligible point, and
that the Duke of Portland looked with some confidence to
the Treasury, is placed beyond all doubt by the following
confidential communication, in which His Grace, in anticipation
of the establishment of the new Ministry, proposes
to Lord Temple his continuance in office as Lord-Lieutenant
of Ireland. It would have been so utterly inconsistent
with the high character of Lord Temple to have
accepted this office under circumstances which he held to
be injurious to the moral influence of the party leaders, and
out of which no solid or durable system of administration
could be rationally expected, that it will not excite much
surprise to find his Lordship declining the flattering offer
of the Duke of Portland.</p>

<p>It should be remembered, in reference to Lord Temple's
reply to His Grace's "secret and confidential" communication,
that the Duke of Portland had held the office of
Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland under the second Rockingham
Administration, and was, therefore, qualified to appreciate
the inconveniences arising from frequent changes in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
the Government. It is to that circumstance Lord Temple
alludes, when he recalls to his Grace's recollection the
"jealousy which had been felt in so many parts of
Ireland at his resignation."</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>THE DUKE OF PORTLAND TO LORD TEMPLE.</p>

<p>(Most Secret and Confidential.)</p>

<p>London, Saturday Evening,</p>

<p>Feb. 22nd, 1783.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Lord</span>,</p>

<p>The events of Monday and last night must have been communicated
to you, and their consequences must be too obvious
to render it necessary for me to point them out. What effect
they may have upon my situation and that of my friends, it
is impossible to say; but the supposition of a probability that
they may tend to our being intrusted with the Administration
will not suffer me to conceal the wish I should in that case
most anxiously entertain for your Excellency's continuance in
the Government of Ireland. As Mr. Townshend's friendship
induced him to communicate to you my sentiments upon your
appointment, you cannot be surprised at my presumption in
the hope I now take the liberty of expressing to you; nor will
it, I trust, be thought unjustifiable or unreasonable, notwithstanding
the endeavours which it appeared to be my duty
to exert for the removal of Lord Shelburne from any confidential
employment in the King's service. I shall not trouble
your Excellency with the reasons for my conduct, as a reference
to the mode of Lord Shelburne's appointment is sufficient
to explain them, even without the comment which his conduct
affords; but as it is not unlikely that the means which have
been represented to you to have been taken in the course of this
short but successful attempt may in some degree prejudice us<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
in your opinion, I am desirous of trespassing upon your
patience for a few moments to assure you that no deviation
from the principles upon which I have acted throughout my
whole political life has been or is to be the price of the assistance
we have had in attaining that object. If, therefore, it
should be the King's pleasure to place the Government in our
hands, the powers of carrying it on must be given to those who
are looked upon to be Whigs, and were considered to be such
by our late most excellent friend, Lord Rockingham. <i>All</i> the
responsible efficient offices will be required and insisted upon
to be given to persons of that description; and though Lord
North or others of the old Administration may make a part of
such a new arrangement, it will be made a <i>sine qu&acirc; non</i> condition
that the powers of Government shall be solely vested in
those who have the advantage of being denominated the friends
of the late Lord Rockingham. I have thought it necessary
to state this outline of our <i>determinations</i> to your Excellency,
to counteract any misrepresentation that may be made of the
basis or purport of our junction with Lord North (to which <i>I</i>
conceive it may be liable, from the very false and groundless
accounts which are reported to have been transmitted to Ireland
of Mr. Fox's speech on Mr. Townshend's motion for the Bill
respecting the Irish Judicature, which I myself heard, and
with which I was so satisfied, upon account of those whom it
was intended to support, of him whom it was intended to reprobate,
and whom I consider as the arch-enemy of Ireland&mdash;I mean
Mr. H. Flood&mdash;that I should have been happy to have spoken it
<i>verbatim et literatim</i>), and to inform you of the terms upon
which I aspire to so much of your confidence as to flatter myself
that you will be kind enough to give me the most convincing
proof of it that a public station is capable of affording, which
is that of remaining in the Lieutenancy of Ireland. This
request is certainly premature, and very possibly may be
useless, as I may never be authorized to make it; but as it is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
not less a testimony of my regard for the public than of my
esteem and respect for your Excellency, I do not hesitate at
depositing it in your custody, and have great satisfaction in the
idea of leaving with you such a pledge of my zeal for the welfare
of both kingdoms.</p>

<p>I am,<br/>
Most sincerely,<br/>
Your Excellency's most faithful and obedient servant,<br/>
<span class="smcap">Portland</span>.<br/>
His Excellency the Lord-Lieutenant, &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c.</p></div>

<p>(ANSWER.)</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>LORD TEMPLE TO THE DUKE OF PORTLAND.</p>

<p>Dublin Castle, March 2nd, 1783.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Lord</span>,</p>

<p>A course of westerly winds having for the last anxious week
cut off our communication with England, six mails crowded
upon me yesterday such a load of public business, that I was
forced to delay till this morning the acknowledgments which
are so much due for your Grace's secret and confidential letter.
I need not say how truly I feel the extent of the partiality which
I have so often experienced, and which has certainly influenced
you against your better judgment in the offer which you are so
good as to make to me. Removed as I am from the immediate
scene of English politics, I am but little able to decide upon
those minuti&aelig;, which are often the principal springs which
move the machine; and under this want of information, I must
confess myself much distressed by the means employed to
obtain an object, in which, for obvious reasons, I should probably
not have engaged, but which in all contingencies I should
hardly have ventured to pursue in the mode which has succeeded.
Both kingdoms stand in need of a solid and substantial<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
Government; and in that spirit of candour which I am sure
will entitle me to your Grace's good-will, I must acknowledge
that such an arrangement as is proposed does not hold out
to me any reasonable expectation of a duration, even as long as
that of the Ministry which it supersedes; and consequently,
that the removal of Lord Shelburne (even if that could be an
object with me) would not compensate in my mind for the real
and solid mischief which these frequent and rapid changes,
which have already taken place, and which in a few months will
again happen, must always bring upon the Government of both
kingdoms; and I need not give your Grace a more convincing
argument than by recalling to your mind the jealousy which
was felt in so many parts of Ireland at your resignation, and
the ferment which the unsettled form of Government brought
forward.</p>

<p>I have stated these few observations from an impulse which I
cannot suppress. If I really was vain enough to think my
continuance in this or any official situation was important to
the public, I would sacrifice much to endeavour to reconcile my
feelings to it; but as I am certain that your Grace's friendship
alone could have suggested to you the option which you have
given to me, I shall truly consult that, in which I shall always
take the strongest interest, your Grace's advantage, honour and
reputation, by enabling you to send to this very difficult situation
some other person, who may have equal advantages with
myself in possessing your good-will, and whose abilities might
enable him to return that debt, by giving solid and material
strength to your Administration. But be assured, my dear
Lord, that I am truly sensible of the value of the offer, and that
this is a real gratification to me. And with these sentiments,</p>

<p>I am, my dear Lord,<br/>
Your very obliged and obedient servant,<br/>
<span class="smcap">Nugent Temple</span>.</p>

<p>His Grace the Duke of Portland.</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span></p>

<p>Lord Shelburne tendered his resignation on the 24th.
"Whether," says Mr. Grenville, "that resignation was to
be accepted immediately, and was or was not to be
followed by the others, I do not know." It appears,
however, from a letter of General Cuninghame's, that the
colleagues of the Ministers were waiting in the ante-chamber,
prepared to follow him into retirement.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Brother</span>,</p>

<p>I don't write to you by a messenger, because I have nothing
decisive to tell you. Lord Shelburne went in to-day to resign.
Whether that resignation was to be accepted immediately, and
was or was not to be followed by the others, I do not yet know.
Nobody has yet been sent to. The report of Lord Gower, or
some other substitution, is very prevalent.</p>

<p>Before you receive this, you will probably have heard from

nothing is settled. Adieu.</p>

<p>Lord Shelburne is now in the closet, <i>resigning</i>, and most of
his colleagues in the outward room, to follow his example.
The Chancellor's resignation is doubtful. General Conway
has been ill since Friday; this morning St. Anthony's fire
broke out in his legs. Mr. Townshend will move the Commons
to adjourn. The whole political system is now in such confusion,
that speculation would only tend to mislead.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span></p>

<p>Tuesday Night, Feb. 24th, 1783.</p>

<p>I expected before this to have dispatched you a messenger,
with an account of the new arrangement; but I write by the
post, as I can only tell you, that neither the Duke of Portland
nor Lord North have yet been sent for, and that the prevailing
report in the House of Commons to-day was Lord Shelburne's
resignation, and a system, to be composed of the remains of his
Administration, joined with Lord Gower.</p>

<p>The House has adjourned till Friday. Before that, I shall
probably be able to write to you more at length. Nothing can
be a stronger confirmation than this, of the truth of your idea
of reluctance and disinclination, &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

<p>There is no other news here, nothing else having been
talked of for the last week but arrangements. The hungry
mouths are gaping very wide, and have fixed their eyes on
morsels which may possibly never drop into them. Adieu.</p>

The offer has been made to Pitt of the Treasury, with <i>carte
blanche</i>; which, after two days' deliberation, he has this day
refused. No other person has yet been sent for. Lord Gower
was with the King on Monday, but I believe no offer made to
him.</p>

<p>Whether the King has any resource left, or whether he will
(as I rather think) acquiesce, God knows. <i>Voil&agrave; tout que je

<p><span class="smcap">My Lord</span>,</p>

<p>I have this instant heard Lord North say, he believed that
Mr. Pitt was First Lord of the Treasury and Chancellor of the
Exchequer; and I know a variety of circumstances to confirm
it. The same army will be fought under another general, in
the expectation of its being strengthened by deserters before
the next action.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>GENERAL CUNINGHAME TO LORD TEMPLE.</p>

<p>London, Thursday Night,</p>

<p>Feb. 26th, 1783.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My Lord</span>,</p>

<p>There seems now no doubt of Mr. Pitt's having been
offered, and having refused, being First Lord of the Treasury.
What may or may not happen to-morrow, nobody can conjecture,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
The House of Commons will probably adjourn till
Monday.</p>

<p>I have the honour to be, with true respect,</p>

<p>My Lord,<br/>
Your most faithful and obedient humble servant,<br/>
<span class="smcap">Robert Cuninghame</span>.</p></div>


<p>The refusal of Pitt, who was sagaciously waiting his
opportunity&mdash;foreseeing what would come of these desperate
efforts to patch up an Administration&mdash;and the
King's personal aversion to Fox, and dissatisfaction with
Lord North for his union with him, rendered it necessary
to look for help elsewhere. In this extremity Lord
Temple was thought of, as one of the few men whose
courage and integrity might be confidently relied upon.</p>


<div class="blockquot"><p>MR. W. W. GRENVILLE TO LORD TEMPLE.</p>

<p>Pall Mall, Feb. 28th, 1783.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Brother</span>,</p>

<p>I have been, for these last five days, in the most anxious
expectation of being able to write to you something certain
about the situation of things here. Still, however, they remain
in the same unsettled state. The invincible repugnance continues
to operate in the strongest manner; it is avowed, and
was certainly the cause of the late offer, which has been
declined; notwithstanding the promises of support from many
of those who have voted with Lord North till now, and who
are disgusted either at his union with Fox, or his conduct to
the King.</p>

<p>To-day, the prevalent report was that you had been sent for.
This I know to be otherwise, in present, though I think it not
unlikely to happen; as I know the King's wish&mdash;at all events
to exclude Fox and North, and particularly the first. If it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
should be so, lights will undoubtedly be given you which I
cannot furnish, to which will of course be added every light
which it is in my power to procure. At present I rather
believe, and from no bad authority, that the idea is, Lord
Gower at the Treasury, Jenkinson, Chancellor of the Exchequer,
and Townshend to manage the House of Commons,
Pitt resigning. But the whole, even from the best information,
is but a scene of conjecture. In the meantime, the
situation of the country cannot be described. The Government
is broke up just at the moment when a Government was
most wanted. Our internal regulations, our loan, our commerce,
our army, everything is at a stand, while the candidates
for office are arranging their pretensions: in the meantime, we
have no money, and our troops and seamen are in mutiny.</p>

<p>One thing, however, is worth your attention: a Bill is to be
brought in on Monday to open our ports to American ships,
putting them, in all respects, on the footing of natural-born
subjects; which regulation is to continue, till it is known that
they refuse to do the like by us. How can this be done in
Ireland without a Parliament?</p>

<p>I cannot apply, for I have nobody to apply to, about your
Peerages. Adieu, my dear brother. One thing is worse than
bad Government, viz.: the having no Government at all.</p>

<p>Ever yours,<br/>
W. W. G.</p>

<p>I still retain my wish of <i>bringing</i> over the third reading, as
I can be of no use in the House of Lords; although I believe
with you, that the disposition to oppose does exist.</p></div>


<p>All parties were desirous of strengthening themselves by
an alliance with Lord Temple. The coalition sought to
engage him even before they were themselves in a position
to treat; and there seems to be no doubt that, at this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
juncture, when every succeeding hour brought new incidents
and unforeseen difficulties, a movement was going on
for placing him at the head of the Government. Mr. Astle,
writing to his Lordship on the 1st of March, says: "It is
the opinion of men of different parties that a majority in
Parliament would act with your Lordship if you was at the
head of the Treasury. From what I have collected in the
course of this day, I agree entirely in this opinion. Some
who have voted with Lord North would draw with you."
How far this contemplated escape from the embarrassments
that impeded the coalition might have been
matured into a practical shape had Lord Temple been in
London, we can only infer from the general confidence
which was reposed in his ability, high character and personal
weight; but his distance from the scene of action
precluded the possibility of carrying the project into effect,
even had he been disposed to accept the position, which
may be reasonably doubted. Events pressed impatiently
for a solution, and the activity of the hybrid Opposition
admitted of no delay. At the very moment when Mr.
Astle was hastily writing off to Lord Temple to apprize
him that there existed this desire to invite him to undertake
the construction of a Cabinet, General Cuninghame
was dispatching another letter, to inform him that a new
Administration was actually in course of formation, of
which he could then give him no further particulars, than
that Lord Rawdon was to be called to the Upper House,
and Townshend to be created a peer. In the evening of
the same day this piece of intelligence takes a more definite
and authentic form.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>GENERAL CUNINGHAME TO LORD TEMPLE.</p>

<p>London, March 1st, Eight o'clock, <span class="smcap">P.M.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">My Lord</span>,</p>

<p>Lord North is now with the King. The Duke of Portland,
or Mr. Fox, will be sent for to-morrow.</p>

<p>I have the honour to be, my Lord,<br/>
Your most obedient humble servant,<br/>
<span class="smcap">Robert Cuninghame</span>.</p></div>

<p>Mr. Fox, however, was not sent for. The King's
reluctance to negotiate with him could not be overcome:
upon that point His Majesty was inflexible; and interview
after interview followed, ending in the same unsatisfactory
way, the country continuing to be kept in a state of
uncertainty and alarm, and, as Mr. Grenville describes it,
"wholly without any Government whatsoever."</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>GENERAL CUNINGHAME TO LORD TEMPLE.</p>

<p>London, March 4th, 1783.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My Lord</span>,</p>

<p>In these uncertain times, it is difficult to relate events with
precision; but I believe there is no doubt of Lord North's
having been near three hours last night with the King, and
that they parted without agreeing to any Administration. It is
said, His Majesty offered to consent to any arrangement that
excluded Mr. Fox and his associates, and that Lord North
thought it was impossible to make up any Administration, to
have the appearance of permanency, without them. What is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
to happen next, God alone knows! All is confusion; and the
gentlemen of landed property are seriously alarmed.
I have the honour to be, with the most perfect respect,</p>

<p>My Lord,<br/>
Your Excellency's most faithful and obedient humble servant,<br/>

<div class="blockquot"><p>GENERAL CUNINGHAME TO LORD TEMPLE.</p>

<p>London, March 5th, 1783.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My Lord</span>,</p>

<p>I continue to write in these curious times, though I am
confident you must have better intelligence from a variety of
other authorities. Lord North's interview, last night, with
the King did not last above ten minutes. His Majesty again
asked him if <i>they</i> (meaning Mr. Fox and his associates) would
be satisfied with a neutral person being at the head of the
Treasury: his Lordship replied, they would only be satisfied
with the Duke of Portland. His Majesty then asked Lord
North if he would accept of the Treasury, which he declined;
and so they parted. This, the Duke of Portland told me himself,
last night, at Brookes's. Mr. Fox said something to the
same effect; but it was too late before Lord North left the
King, to write by last night's post. His Majesty looked very
firm; but what course he is to steer is not yet known.</p>

<p>I am happy to find, from all sorts of people who may be
supposed to know something of ideal arrangements, that there
is no intention anywhere of your Excellency not having the
option of remaining in Ireland; and that it is the universal
wish you may continue there, for the sake of this as well as of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
that country. If you happened to be here now, you would
have the Treasury laid at your feet.</p>

<p>I have the honour to be, with perfect respect,</p>

<p>My Lord,<br/>
Your Excellency's most faithful, obedient, humble servant,<br/>
<span class="smcap">Robert Cuninghame</span>.</p>

<p>His Excellency the Earl Temple, &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c.</p></div>


<div class="blockquot"><p>MR. W. W. GRENVILLE TO LORD TEMPLE.</p>

<p>Pall Mall, Thursday, March 6th, 1783.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Brother</span>,</p>

<p>You will very naturally have expected, long before this, to
have heard of the establishment of some new system of Government,
upon the ruins of that which is now avowedly broke up
in every part of it. Still, however, the country remains, at
this urgent and critical moment, wholly without any Government
whatsoever.</p>

<p>When all hopes were over of forming an Administration
from the remains of Lord Shelburne's, acting under some other
head, the King sent, as I imagined he would, for Lord North;
having previously had some communication with him through
Lord Guilford, whom he saw on Sunday. Lord North has
been twice with the King, and has both times been pressed to
form some system to the exclusion of the Duke of Portland and
Fox, which he has peremptorily refused; alleging the necessity
of strength, and the impossibility of supporting Government in
Parliament, except on the basis of their coalition. The last
time, the conference is said to have ended with his being told,
that if <i>he</i> was determined, he would find that the person who
talked to him could be so likewise. In the meantime, Parliament
is kept sitting, and must be so; because Fox declares
his resolution not to suffer the Mutiny Bill to pass till a
Government is formed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span></p>

<p>In this state of things, it is difficult to do any business
whatever; because those who hold their situations only for the
moment, are of course disinclined to take any step beyond
the mere routine of office. I have, however, prevailed upon
Townshend to speak to the King about the Peers to be created
previous to the &mdash;&mdash;. I enclose my note to him upon the
subject, and his answer.</p>

<p>The Irish Bill stood for yesterday, and as it had been so
often put off, I thought it better not to delay it any longer.
Accordingly, I moved to go into the Committee. (Neville in
the Chair, Lord Nugent peremptorily refusing, and Jemmy not
being well.)</p>

<p>Before we went into the Committee, Percival desired to say,
that as he understood his idea had not been approved of by the
House in general, and that every one seemed to wish that this
Bill might pass without any division or difference of opinion,
he should not now insist upon it, though he was not convinced
that the motion was improper.</p>

<p>Mr. Eden said, that the principle of the Bill met his hearty
concurrence; though he wished to observe that the clause about
the judicature seemed to him so worded, as to declare that
England never had the right of appellant judicature, which was
not the case.</p>

<p>Lord Newhaven said, he saw no reason for not inserting the
clause, and he should, therefore, move an instruction to the
Committee, to receive a clause to prevent any treason, or mis-prision
of treason, committed in Ireland, from being inquired
of or tried in Great Britain.</p>

<p>Lord Lucan seconded him.</p>

<p>Lord Nugent objected to this. He said that, originally,
when attempts had been made in the House of Commons in
favour of Ireland, no man had been a more eager or strenuous
supporter of them than himself. But now, ever since he had
seen the disposition of this country favourable to Ireland, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
that it was the sincere wish of all Englishmen to adopt the
most liberal principles on that subject, he had thought that it
became more proper for persons connected with Ireland to
remain silent, and to leave the measures in favour of that
country to be carried through by Englishmen. In the present
instance, he wished that the clause in question had not been
proposed, because it was attended with more difficulty than the
noble Lord seemed to be aware of. The Act of Henry VIII.,
which had been referred to, had been adopted and confirmed as
an Irish Act by the Parliament of that country. This being
the case, the repeal of the English Act could have no effect
whatever, because the Irish statute would still remain un-repealed,
and could only be removed by the Parliament of
Ireland; whilst, on the other hand, we should be to take away
a law which had been so much approved by Ireland as to be by
them adopted.</p>

<p>Mr. Herbert read the Irish statute alluded to, and said that
the disposition towards Ireland which appeared in every part
of the House, could not but inspire that country with every
sentiment of affection to Great Britain.</p>

<p>I then said, that if the motion made by the noble Lord was
persisted in, I should most undoubtedly not oppose it, because
it was impossible for me to give opposition to any measure
which had even the appearance of adding strength to the
exclusive rights of Ireland; that I was of opinion myself that
the jurisdiction in question was not, by any means whatever,
conveyed by the Act referred to; that the statute of Henry
VIII. was not intended to affect any part of the King's dominions
was clear to a demonstration, from the subsequent
statute of the same King in explanation of it&mdash;the preamble of
which, referring to the former Act, does expressly speak of
treasons committed out of this realm, <i>and other the King's
dominions</i>; and that the circumstance of the adoption of the
former Act by the Irish Parliament was a clear proof that it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
was not considered as an Act which could bind Ireland; and I
could not help wishing that the noble Lord would withdraw his
motion, for the reason stated by the noble Lord (Lord Nugent),
that we could not repeal an Irish Act; and that without so
doing, the repeal of the English statute (even if it did give any
jurisdiction) would be nugatory. Besides this, there was
another reason. The framers of this Bill had certainly never supposed
that it could go to remove at once every difficulty which
might arise, and to settle at once every point which might
require to be settled when, as in the present case, a great
stream was turned into a new channel. Our idea went to the
unequivocal and permanent establishment of those points which
were in the contemplation of Government last year, to those
things to which Parliament then intended to pledge, and to
which I had ever been of opinion they had inviolably pledged
the faith of the nation. That by so doing, we conceived we
should establish a foundation of confidence, upon which all less
important points might be adjusted with mutual temper,
harmony and affection; that Ireland could certainly entertain
no doubt that the same principles which had guided us in the
great and extensive considerations would continue to actuate
our conduct in those of less concern and more confined regulation;
(that in the present case, if the English Act was a
grievance to Ireland, so also would the Irish be to England.)<a name="FNanchor_1_5" id="FNanchor_1_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_5" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
At the same time, however, I begged that it might be clearly
understood that this clause was not objected to on the ground
of its being a new claim on the part of Ireland. Ireland had
last year, in the Addresses of her Parliament, claimed to be a
distinct and independent kingdom. If, therefore, this Act
affected her independence&mdash;and in that light it was objected to&mdash;so
far it certainly was not in any respect a new claim. To
supreme legislation and supreme judicature, all criminal jurisdiction
was certainly annexed and inseparable.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span></p>

<p>Lord Newhaven then withdrew his motion.</p>

<p>Percival said, that the exercise of this jurisdiction had been
antecedent to the Act of Henry VIII.</p>

<p>In the Committee, Lord Beauchamp objected to the word
established, which he wished to alter to the word recognized;
but that, unless it was agreed to, he would not press it.</p>

<p>I said that, as every word of the Bill had undergone the
most serious discussion, and the most attentive consideration,
on both sides of the water, and that as the present form had
been approved of, I wished the Bill might receive no alteration,
in order that it might pass, without any possible difference of
opinion, in any part of the House.</p>

<p>He then proposed to put for ever instead of for the future;
to which I agreed.</p>

<p>To the last clause, to prevent the receiving writs of error,
&amp;c., I moved an addition, which was drawn by the Attorney-General
in consequence of the enclosed papers from Mr.
Travers. I enclose also a letter to him, which I wish you
would let Bernard or Cooke copy, and send to him, with a copy
of the clause in question.</p>

<p>Upon the whole, the business has gone off better than I
expected; though I take it for granted that we shall hear
again, both of the criminal judicature and of the <i>recognition</i>.
Pitt offered to state the objections at large to the latter; but I
thought it better not.</p>

<p>Lord Bellamont has written a letter in the newspapers about
the criminal judicature, which I suppose you have seen. I saw
him in the House, and told him the part I meant to take. He
said he wished it had been inserted in the Bill, but hoped at
least that I would guard against the idea of its being called a
new claim. To this you will see that part of my speech was
directed; and for that reason, as well as on account of the
miserable statement of it in the papers of to-day, I wish that
you would revise and publish it in the Irish newspapers.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span></p>

<p>After this business was over, Eden wished that Ireland might
be inserted in the American Intercourse Bill. I was gone;
but the Solicitor-General said that he thought it pretty extraordinary
that, on the very day that the House had declared that
they had no right to legislate for Ireland, that honourable
gentlemen should wish to make trade laws for her.</p>

<p>I hope to be with you now in the course of a week; but
wait for your answer to my letters, having heard nothing from
you since yours of the 16th of February. Adieu.</p>

<p>Believe me ever,<br/>
My dear brother,<br/>
Most affectionately yours,<br/>
W. W. G.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_5" id="Footnote_1_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_5"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> Query the inserting this, which I omitted in my speech.</p></div>

<p>The letter to Mr. Townshend respecting the Irish
peerages contained the expression of a desire on the part
of Lord Temple to take His Majesty's pleasure on the
subject of an increase of the Irish peerage. Before Lord
Temple had entered on the Government of Ireland, His
Majesty had communicated to him his disinclination to
increase the Irish peerage at that time; but as a dissolution
of Parliament was now proposed, which would
involve in troublesome and expensive contests many
gentlemen upon whom it was supposed His Majesty
might be inclined to confer that mark of the royal favour,
and who had been recommended for it by former Lord-Lieutenants,
Lord Temple thought the opportunity favourable
for such a creation. Mr. Townshend's answer,
conveying the substance of a note he had received from
the King in reply, is curiously characteristic of the
imperative interest taken by His Majesty in all matters
of a personal nature. After expressing His Majesty's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
confidence that "Lord Temple will be as sparing as
possible in his list of peers," Mr. Townshend adds, "Mr.
Pennington must be included in the promotions. If
advances are proposed, the Dowager Lady Longford must
be a Countess; and if any peer of a junior date to Lord
Dartrey is advanced, he must be promoted in the same
degree."</p>

<p>Under the circumstances in which Lord Temple was
placed by the resignation of Lord Shelburne, and the
delays that followed in the settlement of a new Cabinet,
Lord Temple resolved to resign his Government of
Ireland. Unwillingness to embarrass His Majesty unnecessarily
had hitherto restrained him from carrying this
resolution formally into effect; but it appears from the
following letters that he transmitted his final resolution to
his brother, who communicated it to Pitt. The sound
judgment of Mr. Grenville is shown with remarkable
clearness in his observations on Lord Temple's answer to
the Duke of Portland, which was not marked with the
decision demanded by the occasion; and his prudence
and discretion are equally apparent in the advice he
tenders to Lord Temple, upon the necessity of resigning
his office into the hands of his successor, instead of
throwing it up with an "appearance of fretfulness and
intemperance." The contrast between the temperaments
of these distinguished men is frequently felt throughout
this Correspondence, in the traits of calm, practical wisdom
which will be found on the one side, affectionately checking
and controlling the tendency to hasty constructions and
impatient action that existed on the other.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>MR. W. W. GRENVILLE TO LORD TEMPLE.</p>

<p>Pall Mall, March 6th, 1783.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dearest Brother</span>,</p>

<p>I have just received your letter of the 1st instant, and need
not, I am sure, attempt, what I could not do&mdash;the expressing
the happiness and exultation of my mind, and the joy which I
receive from a determination which, however repugnant it may
be to my interests, is perfectly and entirely consonant to every
feeling, to every opinion, and to every wish of my heart, public
and private. With respect, however, to one part of your letter,
I must own to you&mdash;and I take the first moment to do it&mdash;that
after a very serious and deliberate consideration, I should
feel great repugnance to the idea of Lincoln's Inn, and that for
reasons which I hope soon to detail to you in person; though
I will certainly not leave London till something is settled.</p>

<p>Nothing has happened since my letter of this day's date,
which you will probably receive with or before this. The
general idea is that the King is determined to hold out against
the Duke of Portland and Fox. How this can be done, I
protest I do not see, except by Pitt's accepting the offer which
was made to him. Lord Gower and the Chancellor were the
only two people with the King yesterday.</p>

<p>Your letter has confirmed Jemmy in the idea, which was
originally his, and not mine, of the disgrace of being transferred
with the Standishes, &amp;c., &amp;c. Adieu.</p>

<p>My dearest brother,<br/>
Ever most truly and affectionately yours,<br/>
W. W. G.</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>MR. W. W. GRENVILLE TO LORD TEMPLE.</p>

<p>Pall Mall, March 12th, 1783.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Brother</span>,</p>

<p>Before you receive this, which is intended to go by the post,
you will most probably have received a messenger from me with
the particulars of the new arrangement which is going on. Lest
any delay should arise, I just write by this conveyance to let
you know that the King has this day again seen Lord North,
and acquainted him that he was content to waive his objection
to the Duke of Portland's being at the head of the Treasury
and that he desired that a scheme of a Ministry might be
submitted to him on that idea. From him Lord North went
to the Duke of Portland; what has been the result I know
not.</p>

<p>I am sure you will excuse me if I own to you that I do not
quite like your letter to the Duke of Portland, a copy of which
I received from you last night. My objection to it is, that
it seems to court too much, what I understand it will produce,
a second application upon the subject. I subscribe much too
heartily to your reasons to imagine, and still less to wish, that
this application may be successful; on the contrary, I own I
should have desired that room had not been given for it, which
I think is rather too much the case. In other respects I like
the letter perfectly.</p>

<p>I cannot close this without expressing to you what I feel
upon the reception this night of a letter from Bernard, informing
me of your goodness to him, and full of gratitude and
acknowledgments to you upon the subject; it has most truly
relieved my mind from what has been a burthen upon it.</p>

<p>Adieu, my dearest brother,<br/>
Believe me ever most affectionately yours,<br/>
W. W. G.</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>MR. W. W. GRENVILLE TO LORD TEMPLE.</p>

<p>Pall Mall, March 13th, 1783.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Brother</span>,</p>

<p>I have just received yours of the 7th, and am utterly at a
loss to imagine what Mornington can have stated to you which
has given you apprehensions about the Irish Bill. It has
passed the House of Commons without a single dissentient
voice in any one stage of it, and I know of no considerable
opposition likely to be made to it in the House of Lords, except
possibly from the Chancellor or Lord Loughborough.</p>

<p>In all events, I should hope you would very seriously reconsider
the two ideas which you throw out. That of a precipitate
departure, before the arrival of your successor, would bear so
very strongly the appearance of fretfulnesss and intemperance,
and would be liable to so many ill consequences in Ireland that
might arise, and would all be imputed to you, that I own I
should deprecate it in the most eager manner, especially as I
should think you would most fully acquit yourself, both to your
own character and to the peace of the two kingdoms, by protesting
against such a measure, and by declaring your intention of
remaining only till you could deliver over the Sword of State to
some person authorized to receive it.</p>

<p>With respect to the other, it brings back very strongly to my
mind what I felt and still feel on the subject of Eden's conduct
last year. I cannot think that we are either of us justifiable
in withholding from persons in the King's Government any
information upon the situation of Ireland; but that, on the
contrary, the best mode of enforcing acquiescence in your
wishes as to the Bill, would be by a communication of opinions
on the subject. Such a communication must of course be made
with prudence and caution, always bearing in mind the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
essential difference between committing ourselves to a friend
and to a foe. But still, as to facts and leading outlines, I
think we have no choice.</p>

<p>As your letter does not imply any wish of a particular
secresy on the subject (although it is certainly not a thing to be
wantonly proclaimed), I thought it would be a sort of return
for confidential communications which I have transmitted to
you, and a step liable to no objections, to state your intention
to Pitt. Jemmy's opinion agreeing with mine, I took an
opportunity in a few words to say that an intimation had been
made to you of a wish that you should continue, in case the
arrangement under the Duke of Portland should take place, and
that you had thought yourself bound to decline it. (I did not
think myself at liberty to mention the Duke of Portland's
letter specifically, as it is marked <i>secret</i>, although the thing
itself is well known and talked of.)</p>

<p>His answer was very much the kind of thing I expected,
expressing his great satisfaction that your ideas on the subject
of the late Opposition and new Government concurred with his,
and at the same time his concern and apprehensions on
the subject of the effect likely to be produced in Ireland by
such an event. I only added, that he would easily see that
although it was a thing which must in a few days be publicly
known, still it ought not to be talked of beforehand.</p>

<p>I have expressed to you in my letter of last night what I feel
upon your goodness to Bernard. To these I am now to add
my acknowledgments of your kind wishes in my behalf. I will
not pretend to say that I am indifferent on the subject, but I
can with the greatest truth and sincerity assure you that I feel
much more pleasure and satisfaction in the affection and love
towards me which produces those wishes, than I could in the
accomplishment of them to their utmost extent. And whilst I
continue to possess that affection, I shall look with much less<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
anxiety to other objects which are in my estimation of so much
less value.</p>

<p>In these sentiments believe me, my dearest brother,</p>

<p>Ever most affectionately yours,<br/>
W.W.G.</p>

<p>Upon reading this over, I find I have said not a word about a
Ministry. Lord North saw the King yesterday, and from him
went to the Duke of Portland; but at twelve o'clock to-day I
know from authority that the latter had not seen the King,
and that no name was fixed for any one department; which is,
in a few words, all that I know.</p>

<p>I enclose a letter from Tonson, with my answer.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>MR. W. W. GRENVILLE TO LORD TEMPLE.</p>

<p>Friday, March 14th, 1783.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Brother</span>,</p>

<p>We are now not a step forwarder than we were at this time
two days ago. The King commissioned Lord North to submit a
plan of Government, with the Duke of Portland at the
Treasury. This has not been done; nor has the King sent for
the Duke of Portland, who expected that step to have been
taken.</p>

<p>What transpires about arrangements is as follows; Pitt not
to join them (<i>upon which you may depend</i>); Lord North to
name a colleague to Fox, who is to be Lord Stormont, <i>if he
will accept</i>; Lord Dartmouth to be of the Cabinet; Twitcher,
Privy Seal; G. North, Treasurer of the Navy; Grey Cooper,
Jemmy's successor (at which his noble spirit is offended);
Lord J. Cavendish, Chancellor of the Exchequer; Fitzpatrick,
talked of for Secretary-at-War; Lord Keppel to return.
Query, whether he is by this means to be in the Cabinet with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
Twitcher? I think he should appoint St. Hugh a Junior
Lord.</p>

<p>So good night to you.<br/>
<i>Amicite&aelig; sempitere&aelig; inimicetr&aelig; placabiles.</i></p></div>

<p>These arrangements were dependant on the issue of
negotiations that underwent fresh modifications from day
to day. In the meantime Lord Temple had sent in his
resignation. His Lordship's conduct on this occasion was
as creditable to his integrity as it was illustrative of his
temperament. He appears to have accompanied the official
despatch tendering his resignation with a private letter to
the King, which Mr. Grenville, acting on his own discretion,
withheld. Lord Temple, devoted to the principles and
the party of the late Marquis of Rockingham, and regarding
the alliance of the Duke of Portland, Mr. Fox, and others
of that party, with Lord North, as a gross dereliction of
principle, did not hesitate to allude personally to them in
the communication to His Majesty, under the impression
that the coalition was then actually formed, and that
in his public and onerous position he was bound to state
the grounds upon which he felt himself imperatively called
upon to resign. The coalition, however, was not yet
concluded; although, on the 13th of March, General
Cuninghame confidently announced to Lord Temple that
a new Administration was to be declared the next day,
and that that was the last letter he should have to write to
him on such idle subjects; entering circumstantially, at the
same time, into the disposal of the various offices, and
assigning an equal division of the Cabinet to Fox and
Lord North, with the moderate Duke of Portland at the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
head. Mr. Grenville, whose caution in reference to such
transactions had been disciplined by experience, and who
always brought the most temperate judgment to bear upon
situations of delicacy and embarrassment, saw the imprudence
of committing Lord Temple to expressions that
supposed a state of things which did not actually exist, or
which, if it should be brought about, would consign his
letter to the "very worst hands into which it could fall."
Lord Temple, in Dublin, harassed by delays, and surrounded
by increasing difficulties in his Government, could
not decide this point so clearly as Mr. Grenville in London;
and the sequel, which furnished his Lordship with a
legitimate opportunity of stating his views and feelings to
the King, amply justified the course adopted.</p>

<p>In the following letter, Mr. Grenville details the substance
of his interview with the King, arising out of Lord
Temple's resignation. It possesses the highest historical
value, taken in connection with the letters that follow,
for the full and minute information it affords of the course
of those secret negotiations which finally terminated in the
establishment of the coalition.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>MR. W. W. GRENVILLE TO LORD TEMPLE.</p>

<p>Pall Mall, March 17th, 1733.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Brother</span>,</p>

<p>I received your packet of the 12th instant last night, and
immediately sent to Lord Sydney your despatch of resignation.
He forwarded it to the King, who immediately directed him to
send me to Buckingham House, where I was with him above
two hours.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span></p>

<p>I felt myself under much difficulty about your letter. It
was evidently written on the supposition of a Government being
formed by the Duke of Portland and Fox, in conjunction with
Lord North; and to that point its whole reasoning was
directed. Now the present situation in which we are, seems to
tend to some different solution; and this idea was very much
strengthened by the King's note to Lord Sydney, desiring to
see me, in order to talk with me about your staying, <i>at least
for the present</i>. This being the case, I was apprehensive that
some parts of your letter might possibly pledge you further to
him than you would like in other contingencies which might
turn up; and I also thought that a letter of that sort would
come with more force from you in answer to what I should
undoubtedly be commissioned to say to you. To this was added
a most serious apprehension, which had struck both Jemmy
and myself very forcibly, as to the prudence of committing
yourself to him by so very strong language on the subject of
the Duke of Portland and Fitzpatrick by name, and under
your hand-writing; which paper, even supposing no ill use was
ever to be made of it by the person to whom it is addressed,
might, in the space possibly even of a few hours, by any sudden
accident, fall into <i>other</i> hands, perhaps at this moment the very
worst into which it could fall.</p>

<p>Under the pressure of these two ideas, and having very little
time for deliberation, I adopted that measure which I thought
at all events the safest; as, if the delivery of the letter at this
moment, and in the altered state of things, was wrong, it could
not ever be recalled; while, if you thought me wrong in withholding
it, the error could be productive only of a short delay&mdash;certainly
not wholly immaterial, but I should hope not very
important. At the same time I own that I felt much difficulty
in withholding it, as it appeared to me so admirably drawn
up, and so well calculated to produce the effect intended by it,
and so very unexceptionable in all its parts, except that which I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
have stated before&mdash;the mention of individuals by name (especially
those with whom you are living on good terms), in a
manner which, however proper for conversation, is, I think,
infinitely hazardous when committed to paper.</p>

<p>Still, however, I hope that every effect intended by it may
be produced as well, and possibly better, by the letter which
you will of course send to him in answer to this conversation.
I am sensible that, in using this discretion, I have taken much
upon me; but I am sure I need not enlarge upon the motive;
and I cannot help flattering myself, that the step itself will
meet your approbation, especially as the conjecture from the
words of the King's letter was justified in great measure by
what passed during so long a conversation, in which, from the
inconceivable quickness with which the King ran on upon the
different subjects of it, I found it very difficult to put in even
the little which I thought it right to say.</p>

<p>When I first came in, he stated, with many very flattering
expressions to you, the concern which he had felt at the idea of
your resignation; that he had sent to me in order that he
might have an opportunity of letting you into all the circumstances
of the present situation, which he thought the most
calamitous into which any country had ever been brought; that
the kingdom was split into parties, not as had been formerly
the case&mdash;two great bodies of men acting under the different
denominations of Whigs and Tories, and upon different principles
of conduct&mdash;but into factions, which had avowedly no
other view than that of forcing themselves, at all hazards, into
office; that before you took any step, he wished you to be fully
apprized of the circumstances, which he would for that purpose
detail to me, as he hoped that your letter had been written in
the idea of the Government falling into the hands of persons of
the description stated above.</p>

<p>I answered, that I believed you had certainly had that event
in view, as one which the circumstances of the time rendered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
too probable. He then went into a long detail (with a great
number of digressions upon the different political subjects of
the day) of what had passed since Monday's vote, particularly
between him and Lord North, of whom he spoke in terms of
strong resentment and disgust.</p>

<p>He stated, that when Lord Shelburne could no longer
remain, he had first endeavoured to persuade Pitt to suffer the
Treasury to devolve upon him, and that at one time he had
entertained the most flattering hopes of success; but being
disappointed in this, he had tried the Cabinet all round, but
none had the spirit to stand forth. He had then sent to Lord
North (after a week's delay to try other arrangements,
particularly one in which the H. C. and the seals of the
Secretary of State had been offered to and pressed upon Ths.
Pitt), to know whether he was open to negotiation, or prevented
by this coalition; that when, in consequence of this message,
he saw him, he had at first tried whether he would accept the
Treasury; because, much as he disliked them both, if he was to
choose, he must certainly prefer Lord North to Fox. When
Lord North declined this, he proposed that an arrangement
should be made, leaving the Treasury open to some person of
neither party, to be named by him afterwards; that Lord
North left him with this proposal, but the next day told him
that Mr. Fox insisted upon the Treasury for the Duke of
Portland. After some time, he consented to this point also,
and then desired that Lord North would bring him a written
arrangement, that he might be enabled to see the whole, and
form his judgment upon all the dismissals and appointments
which were intended. After two days more, he had sent for
Lord North, who had told him that he had no such arrangement
to bring him, for that difficulties had arisen between
them; that Fox insisted upon removing the Chancellor, in
order that the Seals might be put into commission. To this
the King objected very strongly, as he had expressed his desire<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
that the arrangement might be made upon a broad basis; and
that nothing could be more different from such an idea than
the dismissal of the Chancellor, without having any person to
substitute in his room. Lord North then said that another
difficulty had arisen. He had named Lord Stormont for the
Secretaryship of State; but this had been objected to; and
Lord Stormont had refused to accept of any other situation.
The King again asked him whether, this being the case, he
would undertake it separately. This was declined.</p>

<p>Yesterday evening, at five, Lord North was again at the
Queen's House, when the King told him that he desired it
might be understood that it was not he who broke off the
arrangement upon the idea of keeping the Lord Chancellor;
that, on the contrary, he desired it might be understood that he
had expressed no determination, nor would he express any,
upon a particular part of the proposed arrangement, till the
whole was submitted to him. Therefore, if they thought to
obviate the difficulties which they found in making it by laying
the onus upon him, he was not fairly dealt with.</p>

<p>This finished the detail. His observations upon it were
nearly what is implied in the last sentence: that he believed,
when they came to treat about the arrangement, they found
infinite difficulty in coming to any agreement, and had therefore
resolved to throw the burthen upon him; that, in the
meantime, he was using every endeavour to form a Government;
that he hoped your resignation was only to be considered as
relative to the event which you then thought likely to happen;
that undoubtedly <i>in some cases</i> it would be impossible for you
to stay there with honour to yourself; that unless you met
with full support from hence, the Government in Ireland could
not go on; but, in the meantime, he desired I would write to
you, to express his wish that you would take no precipitate step
till something was finally settled.</p>

<p>This, I think, was the main jut of the conversation to this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
point; though I have thrown it much more into form than it
was spoken&mdash;as it was interrupted by a great variety of digressions:
upon the coalition, in the reprobating of which I took
care to join with him most heartily; upon Fox, whom he
loaded with every expression of abhorrence; upon the Duke of
Portland, against whom he was little less violent; upon Lord
North, to whose conduct he imputed all the disasters of the
country; upon American Independence, which seems to have
been a most bitter pill indeed; upon associations and reforms,
clubs, gaming-houses, aristocratic cabals, &amp;c., &amp;c.; together
with much inquiry into the state of Ireland, and the characters
and conduct of people there; and a long detail about Lord
Bellamont, who he believed was crack-brained, and of whom he
told two curious stories of audiences which he had asked, and
in which he at last insisted that, unless the King would make
him reparation for the second disgrace he had suffered by the
nomination of Lord Arran, by suffering him to kiss hands, on
or before St. Patrick's Day, for an English Baronage or an
Irish Marquisate, given to him, or given to Lord Mountrath
and entailed upon him, he would come no more to Court;
which curious condition, you may believe, has not been
complied with; and consequently, said the King, I shall be
delivered from the trouble of seeing him.</p>

<p>You will easily suppose that I have not been able to recollect
the precise words of a conversation so very diffuse, upon so
many different subjects, and which lasted from eleven at night
till past one this morning.</p>

<p>Upon the whole, what I collect from his conversation, and
from the sort of impression which the whole tenour of his
language, rather than from any one particular expression, is
that in the case which you supposed, and upon which you
acted, nothing could be more agreeable to him than your
resignation; especially, as he observed to me several times,
that it was impossible he could wish that such a Government<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
should last; and mentioned a message which he sent through
Lord Ashburton to Lord Shelburne, that he should consider
him as a disgraced man if, after their conduct towards him, he
ever "<i>supported them in Government</i>, or joined them in opposition;"
(these were the precise words he used to me.) I collect the
same idea also from the expression of <i>some cases</i> in which you
could not stay, and the eagerness with which he joined in with
me when I took occasion to observe to him that the system of
the Duke of Portland and Fox in Ireland had been so different
from yours, as to put you under an impossibility of remaining
under them. This point, therefore, I conceive to be clear, that
in such an event, your resignation would be as acceptable to
him as I think it would be honourable to yourself.</p>

<p>But from the request he has made you, and from the
particular pains he seems to take to throw the onus (as he
called it) of breaking off the negotiation with the Duke of
Portland and Lord North upon their shoulders, I think we
must conclude that he considers that as being entirely at an
end, and that he has something else in view; though what that
something else can possibly be, I am utterly at a loss to
imagine.</p>

<p>At the same time, I think the opportunity of doing a handsome
thing is too fair to be neglected. If I were therefore to
advise you, it would be to write to the King, stating that
nothing could be further from your intention than the throwing
any embarrassment in his way at a moment when, on the
contrary, you would rather wish to do everything in your
power, &amp;c., &amp;c. This would lead naturally to the first part of
your letter, about the manner of your having accepted the
Government of Ireland. You might then say, that the letter
of resignation was written on the idea of the probability of
those men being called to His Majesty's counsels who had,
&amp;c., &amp;c. That under such a Government you could not have
flattered yourself with the hopes of being useful to His<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
Majesty, for the reasons assigned, &amp;c., &amp;c., which I think it is
impossible for you to detail better than they are there stated,
except in the single instance of the mentioning of names, with
no very flattering comment, which I would (if I might be
allowed to do it) deprecate in the strongest manner, for reasons
very sufficiently obvious. You might then, I should think, go
on to say, that in obedience to His Majesty's gracious dispositions,
you would continue to hold your situation till something
is settled; in the hopes, however, if it ended in such a
Government as you could not serve under consistently with
your character, or the system of your Administration, you
might then be permitted, &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

<p>In this manner I should hope that you would lose nothing,
except a little time&mdash;not very important to you&mdash;by the non-delivery
of your letter.</p>

<p>The Duke of Portland had a meeting last night, to which
were summoned all Fox's people, and all the country gentlemen
who had formerly acted with them. The Duke stated to them
what had passed, and told them that the whole had broken off
upon the King's insisting upon the Chancellor and Lord
Stormont. This is pretty curious, at the moment that the
King was stating to Lord North that such a reason could not
be assigned with truth. The Duke said, however, that Lord
North was then with the King, and therefore hoped that
nothing might be done till they heard the result. This was
applied to Lord Surrey, who had expressed an intention of
moving an address.</p>

<p>What passed between the King and Lord North, I have told
you above, as it was stated to me. It is not, therefore, wholly
impossible that the negotiation may be resumed, as the King's
object seems to be to set them quarelling between themselves
about the different parts of this arrangement. At all events, I
think your letter cannot but do good, and I will certainly
remain here to deliver it.</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span></p>

<p>Acting strictly on this sound advice, Lord Temple
addressed to His Majesty the following letter, in which he
enters at length into the peculiar obstructions to which he
had been exposed through the whole period of his
Administration in Ireland, and unreservedly submits for
His Majesty's consideration the reasons which led to his
resignation.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>LORD TEMPLE TO THE KING.</p>

<p>Dublin Castle,</p>

<p>March 23rd, 1783, Two o'clock, <span class="smcap">A.M.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sire</span>,</p>

<p>I have this moment received from Mr. Grenville the detail
of the conversation, with which your Majesty was pleased to
honour him on the 16th instant. I will not attempt to state
the feelings of gratitude and respect with which I have received
the testimonies of your approbation, and the signal proofs of
that condescension, with which you were graciously pleased to
inform me of the situation of the kingdom at this most alarming
crisis. Every feeling of duty and of inclination call upon me
to offer my situation and opinions to your Majesty's consideration;
and, as I have no official means of conveying them, I
trust to your goodness to excuse what must be a long detail,
but truly interesting to me, as your good opinion must ever be
the object of my eager wishes.</p>

<p>When your Majesty did me the honour to destine me to
this high office, I unaffectedly felt that diffidence, which my
inexperience and scale of talents naturally suggested to me. I
will not say that I was insensible to the hopes of building my
honest fame upon the event of my administration, but I
solemnly protest my principal object was to contribute my
small share to the support of your Majesty's Government,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
abandoned in a situation, from various reasons the most critical,
upon grounds which appeared to me upon every principle,
public and private, wholly indefensible. To the natural difficulties
of my undertaking, I had the additional misfortune of
not finding myself peculiarly in those confidential habits with
your Majesty's servants, to which, in such a situation, I should
naturally look for support. My trust, under God, was in your
Majesty's goodness and protection; and I acknowledge, with
pride and gratitude, that I have been honoured with the most
unequivocal proofs of that goodness.</p>

<p>Judge then, Sire, the pain which I felt in that moment,
when I thought myself called upon by every principle of
public duty to solicit officially your Majesty's permission to
retire from this high station. I have not vanity enough to
conceive that my presence in Ireland is material to your
service further than as it will be always eligible to preserve,
particularly in this kingdom, some settled system of Government.
And upon this ground, I hold it my indispensable duty
to lay at your Majesty's feet the reasons which induced me to
believe that my residence in this kingdom can be no longer
useful to that service, to which I will beg your permission to
say I have dedicated every hour and every faculty since my
arrival. And as those reasons cannot be deposited in the
office with safety to the interests of both kingdoms, and as,
for many reasons, it might not be judged eligible that they
should fall into the hands of every description of gentlemen
who aspire to high office, I have ventured upon the unusual
measure of depositing them in your royal breast, still trusting
to that indulgent goodness, which I have experienced, for my
excuse. And if any part of these reasons shall appear to your
Majesty to be painted too strongly, I must apologize truly for
them, though I solemnly declare that the state of facts which
I am about to draw, is the result of cool deliberation; and I
will venture to hope that your Majesty will believe that I will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
not attempt to mislead your judgment either upon facts,
characters, or opinions.</p>

<p>From the first moment of my arrival in Ireland, I have
struggled with infinite difficulties. I was told in England,
that the situation of this kingdom held out every hope which
could be suggested by perfect confidence in English and Irish
Government, and by unanimity arising from the spirit of
gratitude for the liberal concessions made by England. And
I was likewise told, that I should find prepared to my hands
such a mass of solid strength, as would effectually secure the
means of conducting the ordinary purposes of Government not
only with facility, but even with <i>&eacute;clat</i>. Your Majesty will
judge my mortification in finding this kingdom engaged in a
ferment on a constitutional question more violent than that
which had preceded Lord Carlisle's departure, and that
ferment much increased by the injudicious arrangement of a
measure, which might have been truly useful if conducted with
address&mdash;I mean that of the provincial levies&mdash;but which, from
circumstances infinitely too long for the present detail, totally
defeated the only essential object which it ought to have accomplished,
the division of the Volunteers. To this spirit of
dissatisfaction, arising from these two essential objects, I had
not the shadow of Government to oppose. Those who composed
it were respectable for their integrity, and had been high
in popular estimation; but many circumstances concurred to
weaken the advantages which were proposed from their support:
the want of knowledge and habits of office, the thirst of
popularity which pervaded them all, and the fetters which they
had forged for themselves by popular questions during an
opposition of fifteen years, by making them timid and undecided,
rendered them wholly unfit for the defence of Government.
The several characters respectable for their services,
their rank, their connections and their influence, had been
systematically and ostentatiously depressed, except in the sole<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
instance of Mr. Ponsonby, whose influence was unbounded,
and brought forward that spirit of discontented jealousy, of
which your Majesty well remembers instances in the last weeks
of the Irish Sessions. The variety of dismissals, some of
which were considered as peculiarly cruel, had weakened every
confidence in Government, and had spread an apprehension and
distrust through every Board and Department. And the
natural consequence of this was, that the interior business
of the kingdom was much at a stand, while the general expectation
was raised, by professions, to a pitch, which it would
have been found difficult to gratify in a country where the
offices are really insufficient to the purposes of Government.
And at the same time, the confidence which had been given to
the Volunteers, by the attention paid to them at every meeting,
had drawn them into the discussion of every speculative question
which could embarrass the public service.</p>

<p>In this situation, my first object was to restore that confidence
in the equity of Government, which I judged indispensable
for the quieting the alarms of the servants of the
Crown. Every attention was paid which could conciliate the
feelings of those friends who felt themselves proscribed. At
the same time, care was taken not to alarm the very jealous
feelings of those to whom the Duke of Portland had trusted
the Administration. Your Majesty will recollect, that one of
my earliest objects was that of taking the efficient Government
from those from whom I expected no permanent assistance,
at the moment, when by fighting their ground of the adequacy
of the simple repeal, which, from the beginning, I stated as
very hazardous, they pledged themselves to the public to a
doctrine which was truly unpopular, and has completely ruined
them in the opinions of those from whom they derived their
consequence. Lastly, I have never lost sight of that first
essential object, the depressing the Volunteers by every
caution; but with the determined purpose of endeavouring<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
to restore the sword and executive power to the hands in
which the Constitution has so wisely placed them.</p>

<p>Great part of these general opinions appear in my official
correspondence: other parts of this system are palpable with
the smallest clue, and the whole militates decisively against the
opinions of the Duke of Portland and Mr. Fox, whom I particularize,
as they continue to keep up a constant correspondence
with the popular leaders in this kingdom. Your Majesty
will, therefore, judge how perfectly impracticable it is for me
to hope to conduct your Government upon the plan which I
have stated to be necessary to its existence, and which is in
the very teeth of those ideas which have been adopted by the
persons whom, from the exigency of public affairs, your
Majesty has probably been obliged to call to your counsels.</p>

<p>To these circumstances, Sire, suffer me to add my feelings
of indignation at the formation of that coalition to which your
Government has given way, formed at such a time, in such a
manner, having necessarily for its basis the foul abandonment
of every principle, public and private, and holding but one
principle in common&mdash;and that principle avowed&mdash;of forcing
themselves into employments at all hazards to the kingdom,
which never was exposed to such calamities, and, I fear, never
can recover such a shock. I trust, then, that I do not break
through the bounds of that respect, which I so truly feel, when
I say that no consideration shall make me a friend to such a
coalition, or to the component parts of it. These opinions I
have not concealed, having (from a very particular circumstance)
been forced to explain them.</p>

<p>The whole of these considerations will, I hope, justify me to
your Majesty, for a step which I have taken with the utmost
reluctance; but which, in conscience and duty, was unavoidable.
And I trust that you will not for a moment believe that
I could, by such a step, mean to increase those difficulties,
which I would relieve with my life; but that my official letter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
was written under the idea that the new Administration was
formed upon principles and characters which I could not
approve. But in all contingencies this Government has suffered
so materially from the uncertainty of the last eight weeks,
and from the necessary delay of several points which have been
submitted, and which I think most essential to Government (so
much so, that I have been truly importunate respecting them),
that I very much fear the general event, and my own personal
credit, from consequences which I foresee, but cannot now
wholly prevent. But whatever may be my fears, I will not
press this consideration till your Majesty's arrangements shall
be made, in the hopes that I may then be allowed to retire,
particularly if my confidence and good-will cannot (as is too
probable) engage me to the support of the new Ministry.</p>

<p>I need not add, that whenever your Majesty's goodness shall
relieve me from the situation, I shall quit it with that regret
which is the natural result of leaving a great and essential
work of Government incomplete, which I had vanity enough
to imagine I might, by your Majesty's goodness, be enabled to
restore. And with the same vanity I will add, that I had
rather that your Majesty should collect the present state of
Ireland from any one than from myself.</p>

<p>Suffer me then, Sire, to hope that my system and my conduct
have not been unacceptable to you. Suffer me likewise to hope
that your Majesty sees the reasons for this resignation, neither
founded in personal motives of indolence, disinclination, or
inattention to that service which is so truly flattering to me;
nor in others more disgraceful, because they would be more
prejudicial to your Government. And suffer me to hope that
your Majesty sees me yielding to a necessity which I cannot
avert, with a heart filled with the most lively emotions of gratitude,
respect, and affection. With these feelings, it is my
fervent prayer, that your Majesty's wisdom and firmness may
save the kingdom from the calamities which must be the consequences<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
of this unprincipled coalition&mdash;unprincipled, because
they can be bound to no political or moral principles in
common. And with these feelings, I shall retire with satisfaction
to that obscurity from which your Majesty's great
goodness called me, desirous, however, on all occasions to
sacrifice every private feeling, which would naturally lead me
to indolence and retirement, whenever your Majesty shall call
upon me to give you that assistance which every honest man
owes to rescue the Government from a system, which will either
be disgraceful and dangerous if it comprehends the whole of
this faction, or weak and inefficient if it is partial.</p>

<p>Once more, Sire, I entreat your Majesty's pardon for this
long detail; in which, however, many very important considerations,
which have been suggested by the present situation of
Ireland, are necessarily omitted. My reasons for wishing to
quit Ireland have been necessarily secret; and possibly your
Majesty will not think it for your service that they should be
avowed. To your wisdom, and to your justice I submit them;
and must once more urge to your Majesty those sentiments of
gratitude, affection, and respect, with which it is my pride to
subscribe myself,</p>

<p>Sire,<br/>
Your Majesty's very faithful and devoted subject and servant,<br/>
N. T.</p></div>

<p>To this very able and lucid statement His Majesty
returned an answer under his own hand; but it is
desirable, before we lay that remarkable document before
the reader, to trace, through the intervening correspondence,
the "lets and hindrances" which in the interim
marked the progress of the struggle between His Majesty
and the high contracting parties on the other side.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>MR. W. W. GRENVILLE TO LORD TEMPLE.</p>

<p>Saturday Night, March 18th, 1783.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Brother</span>,</p>

<p>I have just heard that all is off. The King has insisted that
the Chancellor should continue, and that Lord Stormont should
be Secretary of State, which has been refused on the part of
the Duke of Portland and Lord North; and upon this the whole
has broke off.</p>

<p>I give you this only as the report of the day; but I believe
the negotiation is certainly off. Adieu.</p>

<p>Ever yours,<br/>
W. W. G.</p>

<p>I write short, as being almost too late for the post.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>MR. W. W. GRENVILLE TO LORD TEMPLE.</p>

<p>Pall Mall, March 20th, 1783.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Brother</span>,</p>

<p>I have this moment heard from indisputable authority, that
the following curious scene has passed. The King saw the
Duke of Portland yesterday, and ordered him to bring him an
arrangement. In consequence of this, a consultation was held
between the heads of the new allies. It was agreed that Fox
and Lord North should be the two secretaries, the latter going
to the House of Lords. It was also agreed that Lord Stormont
should be President, but with a stipulation on the part of Fox
that he should not be of the Cabinet. To this Lord North
demurred; and upon consulting Lord Stormont, the latter peremptorily
refused, telling him that he had explained it differently
to him. This Lord North could not deny, but offered
Lord Stormont his own terms, if he would agree to anything
short of Cabinet. The refusal was persisted in, and Lord<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
North returned to his allies, who were equally peremptory on
their part, and so ended the whole negotiation, Lord North
refusing to treat any further. The Duke of Portland went to
the King and informed him of this, but offered to undertake it
separately. The King's answer was, that such an arrangement
would be liable to all the objections of weakness, &amp;c., as it
would only include one party out of three.</p>

<p>And so ended the treaty of coalition and partition! Coke, of
Norfolk, gave notice two days ago, that if nothing was settled
by to-morrow he would move an Address. Of course, this will
have to be done. My opinion is, that a second offer will be made
to Pitt, and that he will accept. I will write again to-morrow if
there is anything worth writing. Adieu.</p>

<p>My dearest brother,<br/>
Ever most affectionately yours,<br/>
W. W. G.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>MR. W. W. GRENVILLE TO LORD TEMPLE</p>

<p>Pall Mall, March 21st, 1783.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Brother</span>,</p>

<p>If you had not some little confidence in my veracity, you
would hardly think it possible that I was not imposing upon
you when you read my last letter, written at eleven last night,
to assure you that everything was quite afloat, and that the
<i>virtuous</i> band of men, in whom the country places all her hopes
and all her confidence, had made a <i>patriotic</i> stand against Lord
Stormont's being of the Cabinet; and when you read this,
written only thirteen hours later, to inform you that, within
the half-hour, everything is settled between the high contracting
parties for the following Cabinet:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Duke of Portland <i>Treasury</i>.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fox&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lord North&nbsp;} <i>Secretaries</i>.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lord Stormont <i>President</i>, and of the Cabinet.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lord John Cavendish <i>Chancellor of the Exchequer</i>.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lord Keppel <i>Admiralty</i>.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lord Carlisle <i>Privy Seal</i>.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><i>All</i> the efficient responsible offices having thus been required,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
and insisted upon to be given to persons who are looked upon
to be Whigs; and it having thus been made a <i>sine qu&acirc; non</i>
condition, that all the powers of Government should be <i>solely
vested</i> in those who have the advantage of being denominated
the friends of the late Lord Rockingham, and this <i>determination</i>
having been adhered to, I hope no misrepresentation will be
made to you of the basis or purport of the late junction, to
which it might perhaps be liable from any <i>false</i> accounts.</p>

<p>Seriously, however, you may depend upon this list having
been carried by the Duke of Portland to the King for his
approbation. What the answer has been, I know not; but
hope it will be acquiesced in, though I think it not quite
certain, because you observe that no mention is made in it
of the Lord Chancellor, and that consequently the dismissal
of Thurlow, and the putting the Seals in commission, are
implied.</p>

<p>We shall, however, probably soon know; and when I do,
I will send off this, but not before, lest the weathercock should
veer once more from the North.</p>

<p>I am going down to the House, and am to dine with Pitt.
If I send this letter, adding nothing to it, you may depend
upon it that the arrangement is agreed to.</p>

<p>Ever yours,<br/>
W. W. G.</p>

<p>Six o'clock.</p>

<p>I send this by the post, as nothing further is known. Coke
postponed his motion till Monday; and W. Hill gave notice of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
an amendment to it in the words of Lord Surrey's intended
motion last year.</p>

<p>Fox's friends have been holding out for these last four or
five days, as a great mark of sincerity, the <i>determination</i> not to
act with the Chancellor or Lord Stormont. You see how the
last has ended; and as to the first, <i>nous verrons</i>.</p>

<p>I should be much obliged to you, if, as soon as your
resignation is made known in Ireland, you would speak
immediately to Fremantle, to desire him to make an economical
reform in my household, leaving only such servants as are
absolutely necessary for me. I hope to be over with you soon
after the receipt and delivery of your letter.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>MR. W. W. GRENVILLE TO LORD TEMPLE.</p>

<p>Pall Mall, Saturday, March 22nd, 1783.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Brother</span>,</p>

<p>Next Monday will make exactly five weeks from the first
division, during which we have been without any Government
in the country; yet I think it very probable that nothing will
be settled by that day. The Duke of Portland saw the King
yesterday, to carry him the profligate list which I sent you last
night. Very contrary to his expectations, though I own not to
mine, he did not find that ready acquiescence which he expected,
but met with a very cool reception, and was told that the King
would consider it. I do not understand that anything has
passed to-day, and I cannot help thinking that the King means
that nothing should be fixed by Monday, in order that Coke's
motion may come on, and the coalition be abandoned to all
that resentment which has been raised by an arrangement
directly in the teeth of professions and promises not a week
old. Yet these are the men who accuse Lord Shelburne of
duplicity, without having produced one instance during a six
months' Ministry. Think what a situation you would have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
been in, if you had been induced by the assurances in a certain
letter, to have given a favourable answer to the Volunteers,
pledging yourself to stay, and had then received a notification
of such an arrangement. I still believe that the King will
press it upon Pitt. On the turn which things have taken, I
own I wish that he would make up his mind for a short time&mdash;and
the time need be very short indeed&mdash;to the arrangement
which is proposed to him; but as it is, he certainly has gained
a great point in receiving from the Duke of Portland's hands
a proposal to make Lord North Secretary of State. I suppose
he is to be Foreign Secretary, to conclude the definitive treaty.
Do you remember Fox's proposal, when in opposition, to
negotiate the peace for Lord North, because he knew that no
foreign State would trust those who had, &amp;c., &amp;c. Adieu.</p>

<p>My dear brother,<br/>

<div class="blockquot"><p>MR. W. W. GRENVILLE TO LORD TEMPLE.</p>

<p>Pall Mall, March 24th, 1783.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Brother</span>,</p>

<p>Since I wrote last, things have again taken a different turn;
though I am not sufficiently informed of the particulars of what
has passed to say any more than that the King has insisted
upon seeing the list of inferior arrangements, which having
been declined (obviously from a want of agreement upon the
subject), the King wrote a note to the Duke of Portland, which
was very decently handed about at Brookes's last night, to say
that he would trouble him no further on the subject.</p>

<p>To-day the prevalent report during the whole morning, was,
that Pitt had accepted; but when Coke put the question to
Pitt in the House of Commons, previous to making his motion,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
the latter said that he knew of no Administration being
formed.</p>

<p>Coke then made his motion, which I enclose to you, as
nearly as I can recollect it. Very little opposition was made to
it, and it passed without a division, though not without a good
deal of conversation on the part of Fox, Lord North, and Pitt.
Nothing, however, material passed beyond the old ground of
coalition and non-coalition. Pitt's speech was inimitable.
McDonald made a speech which was not very pleasant, supposing
that Pitt should join the Gowers, as it turned entirely upon
an avowal of all his old principles, which he charged Lord
North with having abandoned, &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

<p>I am utterly at a loss as to forming any conjecture, but my
wishes are very strong that the King would suffer the new
allies to make their arrangements, and try their strength. Adieu.</p>

<p>My dear brother,<br/>
Ever most affectionately yours,<br/>
W. W. G.</p>

<p>T. Pitt's daughter is either dying or actually dead, which
prevented his attendance. I pity them exceedingly, for no
people dote more on their children.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>MR. COKE'S MOTION TO ADDRESS HIS MAJESTY.</p>

<p>"That His Majesty will be graciously pleased to take into
his serious consideration the distracted state of his kingdom
after a long and exhausting war, and will condescend to comply
with the wishes of this House, by forming a Government which
may be entitled to the confidence of the House, and may have
a tendency to put an end to the unhappy divisions of the
country."</p></div>

<p>Two days after the date of this letter, Lord Shelburne,
who still nominally held the Seals, formally resigned. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
scene at the lev&eacute;e on this occasion, which may be
described as <i>le commencement de la fin</i>, was not only
curious in itself, but helped greatly to increase the
perplexity in which these strange transactions plunged
even those persons who had the best opportunity of
observing them. "I am just come from the lev&eacute;e," says
General Cuninghame, writing on the 26th of March:
"the Duke of Portland was there, and scarcely spoke to.
Lord Shelburne, Mr. Pitt, Lord Howe, and the rest of
the Ministers present, were loaded with attention. After
the lev&eacute;e, Lord Shelburne resigned in ample form. It is
universally understood Mr. Pitt will not undertake. These
circumstances put together, puzzle the world more than
ever." It was a spectacle in perfect harmony with the
unparalleled oscillations of the preceding six weeks to see
the retiring Ministers overwhelmed by royal condescension,
and the heads of the incoming Administration (for
in the extremity to which His Majesty was now reduced
there was literally no choice) treated with undisguised
aversion.</p>

<p>On the 26th, Mr. Grenville saw the King, and placed
in His Majesty's hands the letter Lord Temple had written
on his suggestion. There is not a cranny of the negotiations&mdash;which
still hung, and which now appeared even
farther from a conclusion than at the beginning&mdash;left
unexplored in this luminous Correspondence. It is quite
evident that the King resisted the coalition to the utmost
extremity, that he tried every available individual, and some
even who were not in a position to bring any strength to
the Government, before he submitted, and that in the end<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
he submitted only under the compulsion of an overruling
necessity.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>MR. W. W. GRENVILLE TO LORD TEMPLE.</p>

<p>Pall Mall, March, 27th, 1783.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Brother</span>,</p>

<p>I received your letter on Tuesday night so late, that I was
not able to take any steps towards delivering its enclosure till
yesterday, when Lord Sydney acquainted the King, at my
request, with my wish to see him. I went there in the evening.
Lord Ashburton was there before me, and had an audience of
near two hours. When I went in, I said that you had been
highly flattered with his gracious communication, and had been
encouraged by it to trouble His Majesty with a detail of your
situation, and the circumstances in which you stood. He
received it very graciously, saying, that he was infinitely
obliged to you for it; that he would take the first moment
to look it over, and would certainly answer it, which should
pass through my hands, as he had never been more satisfied,
&amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

<p>He then entered into a detail of what had passed since I
saw him last. This, however, differs so very little, if at all,
from what I have before stated to you about the Cabinet which
was proposed, and the subordinate arrangement which was
refused, and upon which the whole negotiation broke off, and
has never since been resumed, that I will not trouble you with
it over again. One thing, however, is worth mentioning, of
which I was not before apprized, that the King complained of
personal incivility from the Duke of Portland.</p>

<p>Since the negotiation with the coalition broke off, the Government
has been repeatedly and most eagerly pressed upon Pitt,
who has, however, yesterday, once more firmly declined it.
What the present intention is, I have scarcely a guess. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
King seems as much disinclined as ever to open the negotiation
again, and yet I see no resource which he has. He complained
much that no one would step forth, and asked me whether I
thought Tom Pitt could be worked upon. To this I gave little
answer, except my ignorance, &amp;c.; but I believed I might have
answered decisively in the negative, as he declined even with
William Pitt.</p>

<p>He then entered into a conversation on the subject of
Ireland, stating your universal popularity there, and inquiring
about different people, particularly Scott. This brought us to
the precipitate appointment of the Duke of Portland, and to
the insult which had been offered by it to Lord Carlisle, and
his astonishment that immediately afterwards he could accept
such an office under him.</p>

<p>He mentioned Lord Ely's having applied to be invested in
England, and his having desired Lord Sydney to refer the letter
to you.</p>

<p>I do not recollect that anything else material passed, except
compliments, &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

<p>I cannot help mentioning to you that you have never written
to Lord Sydney, either on his peerage, or your resignation, and
that I cannot help thinking that he feels it.</p>

<p>The Irish Bill sleeps in the House of Lords. The Chancellor
desired to put it off till something was settled. Lord Abingdon
has given notice, in a most ridiculous speech, of his intention to
oppose it. I spoke to Townshend yesterday about it, and he
promised to appoint some day to-morrow for its being read a
second time. They talk here of the Duke of Devonshire for
Ireland. He is a respectable man, undoubtedly, and if you
except the scale of his talents, which I think inferior to the
situation, I know only one objection to the appointment, and
that is a capital one.</p>

<p>Pray communicate a little with Mornington about your
resignation, &amp;c. It will flatter him; and he is beyond measure<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
disposed to you both in Ireland and <i>here</i>, to which he looks
in a short time; but you must not let him know I have told
you that.</p>

<p>Adieu, my dearest brother,<br/>
Believe me ever most affectionately yours,<br/>
W. W. G.</p>

<p>T. Pitt's child is recovering very fast.</p></div>

<p>The allusion to Lord Mornington (afterwards Marquis
Wellesley) is not quite clear. We are left in some doubt
as to whether his Lordship looked at this time to
office in England, or to the Lord-Lieutenancy of Ireland.
His ambition and his genius, however, had ample scope
subsequently in India and in Ireland, the Government of
which latter country was twice confided to him.</p>

<p>In the next letter Mr. Grenville reports another interview
with the King, in which His Majesty expressed his
regret at the absence of Lord Temple, to whom, even at
the cost of still further delay, and some risk of confusion
in Irish affairs, he would still have applied, but for the
impediments which the distracted and unnatural state of
parties threw in the way of the formation of an honest and
independent Administration. Mr. Grenville saw that the
attempt to form a Cabinet in the face of such adverse
circumstances would be attended with no credit to Lord
Temple, or permanent advantage to the King, and
judiciously discouraged it. He appears all throughout,
from the dawn of the alliance between Fox and Lord
North, to have desired that they should be allowed to
make the experiment, in which he was confident they
would fail.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>MR. W. W. GRENVILLE TO LORD TEMPLE.</p>

<p>Pall Mall, March 28th, 1783.</p>

<p>Half-past Seven, <span class="smcap">P.M.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Brother</span>,</p>

<p>I am just returned from the Queen's House, where the King
sent for me about two hours ago. When I came into the room,
he began the conversation by saying, that although his time was
so much occupied in the present hour, he had wished to see me,
in order to express how much he had felt upon reading your
letter to him; that he had never been more pleased than he
had been by that; so much matter in so little space&mdash;the
whole state of our present situation so justly seen, and so
accurately described&mdash;in short, he was at a loss to say which
appeared to him in the strongest light, the affection which had
dictated that letter, or the ability with which it was drawn up.</p>

<p>He expatiated a good deal more on this, and then went on to
say, that he was fully convinced that your not having been here
at this moment was a very unfortunate circumstance, for that
you would have stood forth to assist him. I said I was certain
that nothing would have made you so happy as the possibility
of being of any service to His Majesty in the present crisis.
He answered that he fully believed it, and that the idea had
occurred to him this morning of sending for me, to know what
I thought of it in the present moment, as there was not time
for a communication with you. I told him that there was one
very considerable difficulty which struck me upon it&mdash;"the
distance&mdash;besides that, Sire, the finding any person for the
House of Commons, where it is most likely that the great push
will be made."</p>

<p>This seemed to strike him. He mentioned his having sent
yesterday again to Tom Pitt, to endeavour to persuade him to
stand forward, and his having declined it. He then went a
good deal into T. Pitt's character, speaking very highly of his
good sense and integrity, but expressing his doubts whether<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
his health would ever allow him to take any active part; that,
however, he had received this satisfaction from his conversation
with him, that he had the pleasure of seeing that he approved
of the conduct which he had held. He mentioned his having
shown him the material letters which had passed, and then took
them out of a drawer, and gave them me to read, consisting of
four. One from the Duke of Portland, desiring to see the
King. The King's note to Lord North, desiring to see the
arrangement; and Lord North's answer, enclosing a letter to
him from the Duke of Portland, both declining to give in the list.</p>

<p>While I was reading these letters he went over with me a
great variety of topics, chiefly the same as in the two former
conversations, and very particularly upon the characters of
Lord North and Fox, whom I think he described very justly,
though certainly not in the most flattering colours. The first,
he said, was a man composed entirely of negative qualities, and
actuated, in every instance, by a desire of present ease at the
risk of any future difficulty. This he instanced in the American
war, and in the riots of 1780, of which he gave me a very long
detail. As to Fox, he allowed that he was a man of parts,
quickness, and great eloquence; but that he wanted application,
and consequently the fundamental knowledge necessary for
business, and above all, was totally destitute of discretion and
sound judgment. He paid many compliments to William
Pitt, to Jemmy, to the Major-General, to myself, and above all,
to you, which language, I know, he has within these few days
held most universally, which has probably given rise to the
second report of your being sent for.</p>

<p>In more than one instance, he made use of expressions which,
if they did not absolutely declare his resolution at all hazards
not to send again for the Duke of Portland, at least, have very
strongly impressed me with that idea. In this I may be mistaken,
but I own I so understood him; although I am utterly
at a loss to form any conjecture of what he is looking forward to.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span></p>

<p>After he had gone through a very long detail of this sort, he
dismissed me, saying, that he would certainly write to you,
through me, in a day or two; and, in the meantime, desiring
that you would understand how much he had been satisfied
with you, and how happy he should have been if you could
have helped him.</p>

<p>You see this does not amount to an offer; and the reason is,
I think, sufficiently plain why the offer was not made: namely,
that he had been staggered at what, I fear, is an insurmountable
difficulty, with respect to the lead of the House of Commons.
W. Pitt would certainly not hear of it, after his second
peremptory refusal of the Treasury; T. Pitt as certainly not,
after his refusal, for the second time, together with the comment
afforded by a very long conversation which I had with
him yesterday morning upon the subject; Jemmy has not
health, and still less spirits, for so very arduous an undertaking;
and as for myself, even if equal in other respects,
which I very unaffectedly know I am not, still I am much
too young, and too little versed in the navigation of that
tempestuous sea, to venture out in such a hurricane as this.
Indeed, upon the whole, I think the King seemed more to wish
that you should know he had entertained, and been inclined
to the idea, than to desire to press it upon you, at a moment
when it appears so very impracticable.</p>

<p>I said nothing in my last letter upon the subject which you
mentioned to me respecting yourself, as I had no opportunity
of dropping any hint of it to the King, when I saw him to
deliver your letter. To-night, I certainly had that opportunity,
and would as certainly have made use of it, but that I was
never certain, till the last moment of the conversation, whether
it would have ended by desiring me to state the offer to you as
one now actually made, or as one wished to have been so if
circumstances had allowed it. If it had been the former, a
much better field would have been opened for the application:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
as it is, I will certainly throw out the idea, if I can find any
opportunity of doing it when he delivers me his answer to you.</p>

<p>I shall be impatient to hear your observations upon this
interesting conversation. I certainly did not mean to take
upon me to answer on your behalf in the negative, nor do I
think I was so understood; but the objection which I started,
in order that I might learn if any solution could be found,
appeared to him, having no such solution to offer, as it does
to me, seeing none such which can be offered, totally and
absolutely insurmountable.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the idea of his resolution not to give way,
has most seriously alarmed me. I wish I may prove a false
prophet, but I solemnly protest to God that I am afraid of
the most fatal consequences. In a week's time, there will not
be in the Treasury a farthing of money to defray the ordinary
and current expenses of the Government! Judge how this will
operate upon the seamen and soldiers, who are daily expecting
to be paid off, and who, God knows, do not seem to want so
strong an inducement to mutiny as must be afforded them by
the total want of money. The licentiousness of the people,
already arrived at a pitch never known in this country, is daily
inflamed by newspapers and pamphlets, while there is no
Government whatever to restrain its effects. These considerations
hold out little encouragement to any man; but they
afford an inducement to every good citizen to risk much,
not only of personal ease and personal safety, but also of
personal situation and character, in the hopes of averting the
calamities which seem to threaten us. But if the attempt
should be unsuccessful (and who shall say it will be otherwise?),
it would plunge the Government into greater difficulties,
by cutting off from the King his only resource and refuge.</p>

<p>Two or three days must, by their events, and by the King's
letter to you, enable you to judge decisively upon the situation
of the country, present and to come. The prospect is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
truly gloomy, and the combination of calamitous circumstances
such as to leave very little reason in my apprehension to hope
that this situation will be such as we must all wish&mdash;that of a
settled Government, even in hands which we dislike, if it can
be settled in no other. In the meantime, I do not think you
called upon to transmit to the King any answer to this conversation;
especially as, I suppose, you must naturally send
one to his letter, whenever it arrives.</p>

<p>Adieu, my dearest brother,<br/>
Believe me ever most sincerely and affectionately yours,<br/>
W. W. G.</p>

<p>P.S.&mdash;The Treasury have written to Hamilton to give assurances
of the repayment of the money advanced to Lord
Rawdon's regiment, and to desire a state of that money. The
natural way would have been, to have given you credit for the
whole money due from them to the regiment; but as it is, I
hope you will not any longer think it necessary to stop the
subsistence, as it has so harsh an appearance.</p></div>

<p>Having traced the history of the coalition up to this
point, we now come to His Majesty's answer to Lord
Temple, referring to these transactions. It was transmitted
in the following letter from Mr. Grenville.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>MR. W. W. GRENVILLE TO LORD TEMPLE.</p>

<p>Pall Mall, April 1st, 1783.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Brother</span>,</p>

<p>I have this evening seen the King, and received from him,
with every expression both towards you and myself, the enclosed
letter to transmit to you. I take it for granted that it will
sufficiently inform you of the determination which he has at
length taken, but not avowed, of acquiescing in the Duke of
Portland's Cabinet for the present; and of his wishes, that those
who act with us should hold themselves apart from such a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
Government, in order that he may have something else to look
to whenever circumstances shall allow of it.</p>

<p>At all events, if there is anything in his conversation with
me which is not implied in his letter, I shall so soon have
an opportunity of detailing it to you at length, that I do not
think it worth while to trouble you with what must for the
most part be a repetition of what he has written to you. Our
ground I think clear&mdash;honourable to ourselves, consistent with
our principles and professions, and holding out to us the fairest
prospects of honest ambition. If those prospects fail us, we
shall have nothing to reproach ourselves with; if they succeed,
we shall stand firmly and honourably upon the ruins of weakness
and disgrace.</p>

<p>The King talks of their kissing hands in two or three days.
I shall wait till their inferior arrangements are settled, because
the difficulty about the peerages still remains. They are said
to be pledged by absolute promises; on the other hand, the
King neither can, will, nor I think ought, to give way on that
head. Should they be so weak as to resign on that ground,
their support would certainly fail them, and the road would
be opened for us. As soon as this point is understood to be
settled, I will go back to you; as, notwithstanding our voluminous
correspondence, I wait with the utmost impatience for
the moment when I may state to you in person much which I
have necessarily left unsaid, and, above all, the sincere and
heartfelt affection with which I am</p>

<p>Ever most truly yours,<br/>
W. W. G.</p>

<p>You will observe that part of the King's ground is a resistance
to <i>advancements</i> as well as <i>creations</i>. This seemed
naturally to throw so much difficulty upon your object, that
I thought there would be an indelicacy in pressing it at the
time that you are lamenting the unavoidable difficulties under<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
which he already labours. The delay, I firmly believe, will be
very short indeed.</p>

<p>While I am making up this, I receive yours of the 28th of
March. It is supposed that the King, when he wrote the note
negativing the coalition, either depended on Pitt, or meant by
that means to force him. I have, as far as possible, observed
towards Pitt the line you state, and I think with success.</p>

<p>I have heard nothing till this moment of the pretty negotiation
of which you speak; but do not suppose any man, or set
of men, would authorize the sale of a judicial office.</p></div>

<p>Here follows the letter from the King, enclosed in the
above. The historical interest of this confidential communication
cannot be overrated.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>THE KING TO LORD TEMPLE.</p>

<p>Queen's House, April 1st, 1783.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My Lord</span>,</p>

<p>I had the pleasure, on the 26th of last month, to receive
from your truly amiable and right-headed brother and secretary,
your very able letter of the 23rd on the state of Ireland,
couched in terms that also conveyed the warmest attachment
to my person and Government, which makes me not deem
among the least of public misfortunes, that the want of resolution
in some, and of public zeal in others, will oblige you to
quit a station which you fill so much to the satisfaction of all
honest men as well as to mine.</p>

<p>Since the conversation I had with Mr. William Grenville on
the 16th of last month, I have continued every possible means of
forming an Administration; an experience of now above twenty-two
years convinces me that it is impossible to erect a stable
one within the narrow bounds of any faction, for none deserve
the appellation of party; and that in an age when disobedience
to law and authority is as prevalent as a thirst after changes
in the best of all political Constitutions, it requires temper and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
sagacity to stem these evils, which can alone be expected from
a collection of the best and most calm heads and hearts the
kingdom possesses.</p>

<p>Judge, therefore, of the uneasiness of my mind, at having
been thwarted in every attempt to keep the administration of
public affairs out of the hands of the most unprincipled coalition
the annals of this or any other nation can equal. I have
withstood it till not a single man is willing to come to my
assistance, and till the House of Commons has taken every step,
but insisting on this faction being by name elected Ministers.</p>

<p>To end a conflict which stops every wheel of Government,
and which would affect public credit if it continued much
longer, I intend this night to acquaint that <i>grateful</i> Lord
North, that the seven Cabinet Counsellors the coalition has
named shall kiss hands to-morrow, and then form their arrangements,
as the former negotiation they did not condescend to open
to many of their intentions.<a name="FNanchor_1_6" id="FNanchor_1_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_6" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>A Ministry which I have avowedly attempted to avoid, by
calling on every other description of men, cannot be supposed
to have either my favour or confidence; and as such, I shall most
certainly refuse any honours they may ask for. I trust the
eyes of the nation will soon be opened, as my sorrow may prove
fatal to my health if I remain long in this thraldom. I trust
you will be steady in your attachment to me, and ready to join
other honest men in watching the conduct of this unnatural
combination, and I hope many months will not elapse before
the Grenvilles, the Pitts, and other men of abilities and character
will relieve me from a situation that nothing could have
compelled me to submit to, but the supposition that no other
means remained of preventing the public finances from being
materially affected.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span></p>

<p>It shall be one of my first cares to acquaint these men that
you decline remaining in Ireland.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George R.</span></p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_6" id="Footnote_1_6"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_6"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> This passage is printed accurately from the original. Its obscurity
may be removed by a slight alteration: "as <i>in</i> the former negotiation they
did not condescend to open <i>too</i> many of their intentions."</p></div>

<p>A Ministry forced in this way upon a Sovereign who,
during the twenty-two years referred to in the above letter,
had struggled successfully to resist the dictation of Parliament,
and to break down the ascendancy of powerful families
and party combinations, contained within itself the seeds
of early dissolution. The King accepted them, but never
gave them his confidence. He resolved from the first to
treat them as men who had violently broken into the
Cabinet; and he called upon his friends to withhold their
support from them, and to sustain him in his resistance to
their policy. The ingratitude of Lord North touched him
deeply; and in proportion as he shrank from all personal
intercourse that could be avoided with the new allies of his
former favourite, he turned for succour to men like Lord
Temple, who preserved their honour unsullied, however
their political views, on some subjects, might have differed
from his own. If it cannot be said of His Majesty in this
crisis, that "royalty conspired to remove" these Ministers,
the language of His Majesty's letter (in itself an excellent
specimen of his pure English style and practical good
sense) plainly and unreservedly declares his resolution to
get rid of them as soon as possible by all the means
the Constitution placed in his hands. Lord Temple's
answer frankly indicates the course he was prepared to take
during the existence of what the writer designates as the
"unprincipled coalition." It will be seen in the sequel how
fully he justified the confidence reposed in him by the King.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>LORD TEMPLE TO THE KING.</p>

<p>Dublin Castle,</p>

<p>April 6th, 1783, Thirty minutes past Eleven, <span class="smcap">P.M.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sire</span>,</p>

<p>This moment has brought to me your Majesty's letter.
Every anxiety which I felt, and which my letter so faintly
expressed, is relieved by that condescension with which your
Majesty has deigned to accept the state of Ireland, and of my
situation. Permit me to express my thanks, with every
assurance of that attachment which has your Majesty's service
as my only object, and of that heartfelt concern which presses
upon me at the detail of the situation of your Majesty's health
and feelings, as well as of the kingdom. May Providence long
secure to us that health and life; a resource upon which our
all depends. To yourself, Sire, and to posterity, you stand
acquitted for every consequence, which nothing but the frenzy
of the moment could have forced upon you. The interval is
truly painful, but a short time must rescue your Government
from the fetters thrown round it. My respectful, and (suffer
me to say) cordial attachment to your person, and to that best
of political Constitutions which is hourly threatened, will ever
lead me to sacrifice every private feeling to your service. I
must, however, say, and say truly, that every feeling of ambition
is deadened by these times and circumstances; and that a
public situation has none of those charms for me which have
brought forward this unprincipled coalition. But I have, and
ever must retain those feelings of duty and affection which will
urge me to obey your Majesty's commands in exerting every
faculty for your satisfaction and the public service. The scene
before you is indeed unparalleled in the annals of history.
May those who, by timidity and weakness for some years past,
have driven your kingdoms to the verge of destruction, and
those, who, by a dangerous and unprincipled attack upon every<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
part of the Constitution, are now enabled to avail themselves of
our distress, deeply answer it. My opinions (uninteresting as
they are to your Majesty) have never varied upon that great
jewel of constitutional supremacy over all the parts of the
empire, now torn from your Crown; nor upon the system of
our Government founded on law and practice of ages, which
draws the line between the Constitution of Great Britain
and all other establishments. These principles, from my
earliest infancy, I have imbibed; and if I could reconcile a
deviation from them to my political or moral duties, I will
confess that no hopes of ambition have power to tempt me.
Under these impressions I embarked in an undertaking under
which nothing but your Majesty's protection, and a confidence
in my own intentions, could have supported me. And with
these impressions I retire, with every feeling amply gratified by
your favour and approbation.</p>

<p>May no circumstances delay the hour of your Majesty's
deliverance from that thraldom which bears so heavily upon
you, and may you find in those cool heads and hearts, to
whom your Majesty would entrust your service, that resource
to which you are so well entitled. In such an arrangement, no
consideration will direct your Majesty's thoughts for one
moment towards me, except the conviction (which I will beg to
urge to your Majesty, and which it will be my pride to
cultivate,) of the gratitude, duty, and affection, with which
I have the honour to subscribe myself,</p>

<p>Sire,<br/>
Your Majesty's very faithful and devoted subject and servant,<br/>
N. T.</p></div>

<p>Lord Temple had decided upon his resignation early in
March; and one of the first persons to whom he confided
his determination, was his friend Lord Bulkeley. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
letter conveying this intelligence is so honourable to his
character, and contains so intimate a revelation of the high
principles and paramount sense of duty by which his
conduct was governed, that it will inspire even a deeper
interest than the more elaborate statement of his motives
and opinions which he laid before the King.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>LORD TEMPLE TO LORD BULKELEY.</p>

<p>Dublin Castle, March 20th, 1783</p>

<p>The strange scene, my dearest Bulkeley, of the last month,
has left me little time (even if my public duty would have
allowed me) to have communicated with you upon the subject
of your last letter, and of my present or future situation. The
constant intelligence which I have had from England, has
enabled me to form a very adequate judgment upon the state of
your politics, the complexion of them altered every moment;
and I have been obliged to preserve a most cautious and scrupulous
silence upon the variety of subjects which the last
anxious month has presented. My line has been for several
days past decisively taken; but I have not till this day thought
myself at liberty to avow to any one that I have requested from
the King that he will release me from a situation in which I
can no longer be useful; for no consideration shall tempt me
to hold this Government, where I do not see my way in
the English Cabinet, whose formation must ever revolt and
disgust me. I have much to say upon this point, more than
I can include in a letter, which from my want of time must be
short; but my brother William, who will deliver you this letter
open, will tell you in detail what I feel upon the subject. I do
not say that I am indifferent to what I sacrifice; Ireland holds
out a career the most brilliant to my honest fame; but there<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
are feelings which I would not exchange in the present moment
for all that the two kingdoms could bestow: to those feelings,
whenever you are in public office, I recommend you; and trust
me that they will amply repay you for any change which a
resignation may make in your situation. To those scenes of
domestic happiness which have hitherto blessed me, I shall
with pleasure return; and in those scenes I shall look for your
friendship with the same warm feelings with which I first
embraced it; for in all situations I shall, and must, be to you
the same George Grenville, and no longer to any one</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sancho Pan&ccedil;a</span>, the Governor.</p></div>

<p>Mr. Townshend, who had filled the office of Secretary
of State for the Home Department under Lord Shelburne,
and had been just elevated to the peerage (March 6th,
1783) as Baron Sydney of Chiselhurst, was the only
member of the Administration who had cordially concurred
with Mr. Grenville in his efforts to forward the
unfortunate Irish Bill in which Lord Temple was so
deeply interested. Previously to his retirement from
office, Lord Temple, reminded of his neglect by Mr.
Grenville in not having earlier forwarded his congratulations,
addressed the following letter to Lord Sydney. A
closer acquaintance afterwards sprang up between them,
and was ripened into an intimate friendship before the
close of the year. "I cannot conclude," observes Lord
Sydney, at the close of a letter dated October 27th, 1783,
"without expressing, in the strongest manner, how
sensible my family, as well as myself, are of the civilities
we received at Stowe during the agreeable time which we
spent there. We drink your health every day, and desire,
<i>en corps</i>, to be remembered to your Lordship and Lady<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
Temple, and to the rest of the party at Stowe, in the
kindest manner."</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>LORD TEMPLE TO LORD SYDNEY.</p>

<p>Dublin Castle, April 2nd, 1783.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Lord</span>,</p>

<p>I have been waiting for some days (now almost weeks) for
my delivery; but finding the situation of Government so
uncertain, I will not delay to the period when our correspondence
would naturally have closed, my cordial acknowledgments
for the very steady, honourable, and let me call it
affectionate support which you have given me in the complicated
scene of the four winter months, and in the whole detail of
our communications. I shall ever think of it with gratitude;
but if I were vain enough to think my presence in Ireland
necessary, you have effectually prevented my continuance by
a candour and sincerity, which I could little expect in your
successor. Upon these grounds of good-will to those with
whom I acted, and of detestation of that coalition to which you
have given way, I have, without communication with any one,
sent to you my letter of resignation. I am not insensible to
the sacrifice; for arduous as the station most truly is, I had
hopes at this early period of my life to have built my honest
fame upon the event of my Administration. Those prospects
are vanished, but I have that satisfaction in reflecting upon the
scene of these last six months, which amply contents me. As
to future events, let those who have played this desperate game,
deeply answer it; and upon that subject (as far as it relates to
this kingdom) I will say nothing, as you will, from my
despatches, have collected all that can occur to me. God
knows whether this may still find you Secretary; if it should,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
I wish you to write to me an ostensible letter, in the strongest
terms, upon the conduct of the Portuguese, with respect to our
trade at Lisbon. If you had all remained in office I should
have seriously proposed reprisals on their effects in our ports,
as the only means to bring them to a sense of what is due to
Ireland; as it is, I wish for many reasons to leave to Ireland a
proof of the pains which you know I have taken upon that
subject.</p>

<p>Adieu, my dear Townshend; excuse the name, it has
dropped from my pen, and reminds me that I have not assured
you of the cordial interest I take in your creation; but till I
am more familiarized to Sydney, the former name more easily
recalls those feelings of regard, with which I am ever,</p>

<p>Your very faithful and affectionate servant,<br/>
(Signed) <span class="smcap">Nugent Temple</span>.</p>

<p>Many thanks for your exertions on Lord Rawdon's business:
it has been shamefully delayed, and I thought the stoppage
of subsistence the likely means to bring it forward; but you
will easily believe that I have taken care, though it is nominally
stopped, yet that the men are paid.</p>

<p>Rt. Hon. Lord Sydney.</p></div>

<p>By this time the arrangements were completed, and the
new Ministers had kissed hands.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>MR. W. W. GRENVILLE TO LORD TEMPLE.</p>

<p>Pall Mall, April 2nd, 1783.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Brother</span>,</p>

<p>I enclose a paper containing the new arrangement, who kissed
hands to-day. The King sent last night to Lord North, to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
bid him tell them that they were to come to the lev&eacute;e to-day
to kiss hands.</p>

<p>You will, as I understand, have the supreme felicity of
receiving from the Right Honourable Frederick Lord North, a
notification of his appointment; though I hear to-day that
Fox is to take Ireland as part of the <i>Foreign</i> Department.</p>

<p>I hear nothing of your successor. Adieu.</p>

<p>Ever yours,<br/>
W. W. G.</p></div>

<p>On the day on which this letter was written, the Duke
of Portland was publicly announced as First Lord of the
Treasury, Fox and Lord North as joint Secretaries of
State (an arrangement which explains Mr. Grenville's
allusion to Ireland as part of the <i>Foreign</i> Department),
Lord John Cavendish as Chancellor of the Exchequer,
Lord Keppel, First Lord of the Admiralty, Viscount
Stormont, President of the Council, and the Earl of
Carlisle, Privy Seal. The King had endeavoured in vain
to retain the services of Lord Thurlow. Upon this point,
which had been ceded very reluctantly by the Shelburne
Cabinet, the coalition Ministers were inexorable. They
insisted upon putting the Seal into commission, with Lord
Loughborough as First Commissioner; and, as they were in
a position to dictate their own terms, His Majesty at last
gave up this point, to which he had clung with more
tenacity than all the rest.</p>

<p>His Majesty's attachment to Lord Thurlow may possibly
have been founded on the conviction that he could
securely calculate on the allegiance of a man who was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
ready to avail himself of every opportunity to promote his
own interests, and who might therefore be expected, on all
occasions, to pay a deferential attention to the wishes of
the King. His Lordship's subsequent conduct during the
Regency discussions in 1788 afforded a conspicuous proof
of his unscrupulousness: when, upon hearing one night, at
Carlton House, from one of the King's physicians, of the
approaching convalescence of His Majesty, he went down
at once to the House, and, to the utter astonishment of
everybody, undertook a defence of the King's rights
against the Prince and the Whigs, with whom, up to that
moment, he had been engaged actively intriguing on the
other side. The same implicit devotion to the ascendant
authority might no doubt have been looked for from Lord
Loughborough, who was a thorough party-man. But
there was a certain sturdiness in Thurlow, that rendered
him a more valuable adherent, and a more formidable
antagonist. He seems to have regarded all mankind
with distrust. On the Bench, his disposition vented
itself in judgments remarkable for their brevity and the
irascible tone in which they were delivered. His utterance
was sonorous, with the mysterious pomp and
grandiloquence of an oracle, kindling up at times into
solemn denunciation. His "make up" must have been
perfect in its way, from the awful air of preparation for
which his speeches are said to have been so remarkable.
Thurlow acted with Pitt and the Whigs, and was pronounced
equally impracticable by both. Pitt complained
of him that he was always raising difficulties, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
strangely irresolute of purpose on public measures, for a
man who was so decided on the Bench. The Whigs
had the same complaint against him, and were always
embarrassed by him, and at a loss to know how he
would act on particular emergencies. Throughout these
letters, numerous traces will be found of the continual
doubts and apprehensions with which he inspired them.</p>

<p>Lord Loughborough's career was no less remarkable for
violence, and the unconscientious pursuit of professional
promotion, to which he made all other objects subservient.
He and Thurlow had been Solicitor and Attorney-General
under Lord North's Administration, and were amongst its
most strenuous supporters; although the former had
entered Parliament in uncompromising hostility to Lord
North's Cabinet, and distinguished himself for some years
as one of its bitterest assailants. Having thus opposed
Ministers in the early period of their Government, when
their measures were most deserving of support, he joined
them on the eve of the American war, when their
measures were most open to objection; and carried his
partizanship to such a height, that even the judicial function
did not restrain his zeal. While he was Chief Justice of
the Common Pleas, he made war upon Pitt's Administration
in the Upper House, where he headed the Foxite
Opposition, and became one of the boldest and, consequently,
one of the most dangerous of the Prince's advisers
on the Regency question.</p>

<p>The coalition, which placed the Seals in the hands of
Lord Loughborough, is so vigorously and minutely<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
pourtrayed in this Correspondence, that it need not here
be further alluded to. Its origin, progress and fate present
one of those instructive episodes in political history which
all statesmen may consult with advantage, and which they
will find amply detailed in these letters. The disgrace of
the junction certainly lay more heavily on the Whigs than
on Lord North. Fox had spent his whole life in
assailing the person and policy of Lord North, whose
principles were utterly opposed to his own; yet he entered
into a Cabinet compact with this very Minister, because
Lord Shelburne and Mr. Pitt had endeavoured to repair
the errors of his Government&mdash;the very errors Mr. Fox
had all along condemned&mdash;by negotiating a peace which,
upon the whole, was more favourable than could have been
reasonably expected. Three years before, Lord North
made an overture to the Rockingham party for a coalition,
but it was rejected; and that which Lord Rockingham
considered to be a violation of consistency and an abandonment
of principle was, on this memorable occasion, not
only adopted by Fox, but negotiated under circumstances
which for several weeks placed the interests of the empire
in jeopardy. We shall probably never learn with whom
the movement originated in the first instance; but that it
was pursued with equal earnestness on both sides, admits
of no doubt. The only point upon which the contracting
parties appear to have differed was the distribution of
offices!</p>

<p>One of Lord North's first steps in office, was to address
a conciliatory and complimentary letter to Lord Temple;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
but it was too late&mdash;no temptations could have induced
his Lordship to retract.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>LORD NORTH TO LORD TEMPLE.</p>

<p>Secretary of State's Office, Whitehall,</p>

<p>April 5th, 1783.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My Lord</span>,</p>

<p>I must beg your Excellency's permission to accompany the
despatches which are going to Ireland, by a few lines in a
private letter, to express my great concern to find, upon my
entrance into this office, that your Excellency has taken a
resolution to quit your Government. The important station
which you now fill never, I believe, required more discretion
and more firmness than at the present moment; and there was,
perhaps, never more difficulty in finding any person capable and
willing to succeed to an office of such consequence, and to give
to His Majesty and to the people of Ireland the satisfaction
which your Excellency has done.</p>

<p>If, in the situation in which His Majesty has been pleased to
place me, I can be of any service to your Excellency, I hope
that you will command me without scruple; and be assured
that I shall rejoice in every opportunity of showing the respect
with which I have the honour to be,</p>

<p>My Lord,<br/>
Your Excellency's most faithful, humble servant,<br/>
<span class="smcap">North</span>.</p></div>

<p>The Administration had hardly entered upon its functions,
when its overthrow became an object of speculation.
Everybody saw that it could not stand. It began in a
false position, and had not the power to recover itself.
General Cuninghame writes to Lord Temple, on the 9th
of April: "Lord North will not be called to the House<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
of Peers till the question on Representation has been
discussed in the Commons, then that House will be left
entirely to Mr. Fox, and from that moment many wise
men already begin to date his downfall. I do not meet
with any who think the present arrangement looks permanent.
Nobody now pretends to guess who will go to
Ireland. The Duke of Devonshire has put himself entirely
out of the question, and Lord Fitzwilliam still declines it."
This intelligence is corroborated by Mr. Grenville.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>MR. W. W. GRENVILLE TO LORD TEMPLE.</p>

<p>April 9th, 1783.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Brother</span>,</p>

<p>I waited till this morning to deliver the Badge, &amp;c., in hopes
of receiving your answer to the letter of the 1st instant; but
receiving last night, by messenger, yours of the 4th, and perceiving
that you had not then received it, I thought I could not
any longer delay it.</p>

<p>As it was late before I could get in, I had very little conversation.
I think it, however, right to mention to you, that he
asked me whether I had heard anything of their having written
a letter to you, pressing you to stay; and that when I said that
I knew nothing of it except from common report, but had
heard that His Majesty's name had been made use of to induce
you to stay, he answered that it might be so, but if it had, it
was without his consent, or even knowledge.</p>

<p>I send this to you by express, because I cannot help giving
credit to the report, and the rather, because I hear nothing of
any successor being appointed. The Duke of Devonshire has
positively refused; <i>so has Lord Derby</i>; and Lord Fitzwilliam
(the properest man they have to send) has declined it on
account of Lady Fitzwilliam's health, which makes it absolutely<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
impossible for her to undertake such a journey. My opinion,
however&mdash;and, I confess, my hope&mdash;is, that he will at last
be prevailed upon. I have as yet had no sort of communication
with our new Secretary, having sent your despatch to Lord
Sydney, to whom it was addressed.</p>

<p>Nothing is yet done on the Irish Bill. It has waited till
now for the appointment of a Government; and that being at
last so happily settled, I applied to Lord Sydney to proceed
with it. He told me he wished first to ask the Duke of Portland
what his intentions were on the subject, in order to give him an
opportunity of taking it up if he chose it. This coincided
perfectly with what has always been my idea on the subject,
that it ought to proceed from Government; and accordingly we
went (in the House of Lords) to the Duke of Portland, who
seemed not a little embarrassed, but, however, said he would
take it up, and would move for the second reading for Thursday
or Friday next&mdash;which he has <i>not</i> done.</p>

<p>I mean to-morrow to ask him about it; and if he shuffles,
shall press Lord Sydney to go on with it. I do not think it
impossible that Ponsonby either has or will desire him to
amend it. If this should be the case, it must be returned into
the House of Commons, where I will certainly attend it, and
speak my opinion very freely and plainly upon it. Mornington
tells us that Yelverton is dissatisfied with it, as not recognising
<i>the original inherent right</i> (you see the consistency of these
men!); but that Grattan defends it, and he himself approves.</p>

<p>Fitzpatrick, Secretary-at-War, selling his commission, but
not his rank; Conway being continued on the staff, in order
to prevent Fitzpatrick's issuing the military orders, to which
flattering solution Conway submits; Lord Hertford, Chamberlain;

Paris; Lord Sandwich outrageous, and in violent opposition;

<p>Lord Mansfield, Speaker, House of Lords; Lord de Ferrars
resigns; Duke of Richmond, ditto, and violent.</p>

<p>April 11th.</p>

<p>So far, I wrote on Wednesday; but delayed sending it, in
the hopes of having something more to write to you on the
Irish Bill, and in the full confidence that their letter, even if it
has been sent, which I doubt, is not likely to make any very
great impression upon you.</p>

<p>To-day I attended the House of Lords, as it had been agreed
that the Irish Bill should come on. To my utter astonishment,
the Duke of Portland, so far from performing his promise, got
up when the order of the day was called for, and said, that as
the Bill was brought in before he came into office, he did not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
consider himself as responsible for its contents. The Duke of
Richmond, on this, attacked him pretty warmly on the idea of
a Minister suffering a Bill of such magnitude to go on, without
having some settled opinion to declare upon it.</p>

<p>A little more conversation of this sort passed, of which you
will probably see the detail in the papers, better than I can
give it you. It ended by fixing the second reading for Monday,
for which day the Lords are summoned. The Chancellor
paid you a great many compliments, lamenting your departure,
&amp;c.; and saying, at the same time, very justly, that if
a new Government was to take place in Ireland, they might
possibly be to adopt a system directly contrary to that to
which the Bill is calculated.</p>

<p>Lord Sydney is to move it on Monday; the Duke of Portland
having told him (in consequence of his having, at my
desire, put the question explicitly to him), that he meant to
take no part in it. Probably, however, this determination will
last only till he gets a fresh set of instructions from Fox.</p>

<p>The news of the day is, that they are quarrelling about
having Lord Loughborough of the Cabinet. I am going to
the King to deliver your letter, and if it be true, shall very
likely hear it.</p>

<p>12th.</p>

<p>Nothing material passed last night, as I was a very short
time with the King, and the conversation was quite general;
so much so, that I had no kind of opportunity to introduce
what you mentioned to me, and I am sure you agree with me,
that it was impossible for me to begin that sort of conversation.</p>

<p>I have delayed this letter till to-day, in order to send you
the papers containing the debate, which is very accurately
stated in them.</p>

<p>I have seen Lord Sydney to-day about this Bill, and I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
think we have settled, at last, that on Monday he should move
for the second reading, stating a little the grounds of the Bill,
and should then proceed to say that the Bill was taken by us
out of Lord Beauchamp's hands, because we thought it proper
that whatever was done in a business of this nature should
proceed from Government; that, for the same reason, having
brought it to this stage, he would now resign it into the
hands of the present Government. It is a measure which
cannot be indifferent: if it accords with the new system to
be pursued in Ireland, the persons who are to carry on that
system should adopt and forward it. If their system is to be
contrary to it, nothing can then be so pernicious as a Bill upon
the subject of Ireland passed in opposition to the ideas of
Government. The object of the Bill certainly must be to
conciliate the affections of the people of Ireland to Government
there, and in England. Would this object be answered, if the
Bill be passed without the express concurrence and consent of
that Government which now exists? Will not the effect be
the direct contrary, if they are to be told&mdash;which was Yelverton's
expression to Mornington&mdash;that the Bill puts Ireland
in a worse situation than before the Repeal?</p>

<p>The more I think all this over, the more I am convinced that
we ought not to commit ourselves to the event of a measure
which is already so much found fault with by the Duke of
Portland's people. If a Lord-Lieutenant of theirs is appointed,
he will be to condemn it, and to give fresh encouragement to
another ferment, which will be to be allayed by some new
measure here. Surely, all this is neither for the peace of
Ireland, nor for the dignity of Great Britain. Upon these
grounds it is, that I think Lord Sydney ought to leave the
business to them.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>MR. W. W. GRENVILLE TO LORD TEMPLE.</p>

<p>Pall Mall, April 15th, 1783.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Brother</span>,</p>

<p>I enclose you the papers of this morning, which will give you
a pretty exact idea of the conversation, rather than debate,
which took place upon the second reading of the Irish Bill.
The "Morning Post" comes nearest to the Duke of Portland's
speech. That in the "Morning Chronicle" was evidently inserted
by some of their people (to whom that paper is devoted),
and contains rather what he ought to have said, and, perhaps,
what he was instructed to say, than what he actually did say.
None of the papers have, however, given the following words,
which I remarked to Mornington the moment they were spoke,
and took down upon paper as soon as I came home, so that I
can be positive as to their having been exact.</p>

<p>"As to this Bill, I concur in it, because I think it was made
<i>necessary</i> by what was done last year, and consider it as <i>a
necessary consequence</i> of that."</p>

<p>After this, I hope we shall not have to hear Mr. Fox, in
England, or those whom he supposes his friends in Ireland,
say, what Mr. Fox said when the Bill was first moved for, that
it was <i>wholly unnecessary</i>.</p>

<p>I waited to send this off till I saw whether there would be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
any alteration proposed, or any debate on the wording of the
Bill in the Committee. I went to the House, and there saw
Lord Thurlow, who told me that if the Bill had not come
recommended by you, he should have had a great deal to say
upon it; but as it was, he meant not to speak at all with respect
to it, on your account.</p>

<p>I hear nothing of any successor to you, and begin to be a
little uneasy about it, for a reason which Jemmy desired me to
press to you, though, I confess, it appears stronger to him than
it does to me. What I mean is, that in the manner in which
these people are going on, throwing away the scabbard entirely
both with the King and the people, it is utterly impossible but
that they must overturn themselves almost immediately; and if
a change should happen while you are still in Ireland, you
could have no excuse for not remaining, which, after all that
has passed, would be most unpleasant.</p>

<p>Now for my own part, I own I do not expect quite so sudden
a dissolution of the present Government, because I am sure
they will not resign, and I do not think the King will be able
to turn them out till the session is over. Still, however, your
being here would be very material, standing in so high a
situation as you do; and in that idea I have a wish, if you
should not disapprove of it, to take an opportunity in the
House of Commons, immediately after the holidays (or at least
as soon as I can hear from you, supposing nobody appointed
before), to call the attention of the House to the situation of
Ireland, suffering at least as much from an interregnum as
this country did, and to say that the same motives which made
it, in the opinion of all the world, necessary for Lord Shelburne
and Pitt actually to quit their situations before a successor was
appointed, rather than hold responsible office without responsibility,
must also in the end actuate you, however unwilling,
&amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

Duke of Dorset forced out at the requisition of the Prince
of Wales, contrary, as it is said, to an express promise made to
him by the King. Fortescue (Lord Clermont's nephew) desired
me to remind you of a promise of the Linen Board next after
two, which, he says, is now the case.</p>

<p>Ever yours,<br/>

<p>Up to this time, no successor was found for Lord
Temple. Mr. Grenville, writing on the 19th, says:
"They are under real difficulties about your successor.
They have offered the situation even to Lord Althorpe,
who refused it two days ago. I rather think, putting
together circumstances and appearances, that it will end
in Lord Hillsborough." A successor, however, was at
last found in the person of Lord Northington.</p>

<p>April 25th, 1783.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Brother</span>,</p>

<p>I believe I may at last congratulate you upon the appointment
of Lord Northington, and Wyndham of Norfolk, to succeed
us in our respective situations. It is not yet publicly notified,
but I have every reason to think that you may depend upon my
information. As soon as it is declared, I mean to see them, in
order to settle with the former the time which he wishes to
have for his preparations, &amp;c., and with the latter the taking
such of my things as he may be disposed to. After that I
think of setting out for Ireland <i>tout de suite</i>. There is no
public news that I hear of. Things seem to remain pretty
much in the same situation as when I wrote last.</p>

<p>Adieu, my dearest brother,<br/>

<p>A short correspondence took place, at this juncture
between the Duke of Portland and Lord Temple. It
is impossible not to perceive, or to suspect, in the Duke
of Portland's letter, a certain consciousness of the discredit
attached to his position. He deprecates, in a tone
of courtierly sensitiveness, all allusion to the political
changes which have separated him from Lord Temple
in public life, and, with the air of one who is not quite
satisfied with himself, he seeks to turn his unconfessed
distrust of the course he has adopted into a compliment
to his correspondent. Lord Temple's reply is strongly
marked with the true character of the writer&mdash;frank, bold,
honest above all things, and straight to the purpose. The
reproach contained in his closing words&mdash;that it severely
pained him to think he had reason to complain of the
personal conduct of a Ministry, chiefly composed of "those
who had the advantage of being denominated the friends
of the late Lord Rockingham"&mdash;terminates appropriately
a correspondence which could not be maintained with
much satisfaction on either side.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>THE DUKE OF PORTLAND TO LORD TEMPLE.</p>

<p>London, Saturday, April 26th, 1783.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Lord</span>,</p>

<p>I am very much ashamed at having so long delayed my very
sincere thanks for the effectual attention your Excellency has
given to my wishes in favour of Mr. Coppinger and Mr. Doyle.
My gratitude for this mark of your friendship is not less sincere
than that which poor Doyle feels, and I certainly could not do
more justice to it than by expressing it in the same terms which
he has used upon this occasion, as they most emphatically<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
describe the feelings of his heart. I cannot say that this circumstance
has added to the concern with which I learnt your
determination to resign the Government of Ireland, because the
measure of the misfortune was full before this event, but it
considerably increases the regret with which I contemplate the
difference of opinion which now subsists between us, and almost
inclines me to doubt the degree of obedience which my ideas of
duty to the public make requisite. But this is a subject upon
which my silence hitherto must indicate my disinclination to
enter. I wish, at this moment, as little to defend as to arraign.
Your Excellency is as well satisfied with your conduct as I am
with mine. Time may do more than argument, and desirous
as I am for the concurrence of your opinion upon public questions,
continue me in the possession of your private friendship,
and I will accept that as an auspicious omen.</p>

<p>I am, with great truth and regard,<br/>
My dear Lord,<br/>
Your Excellency's most obedient and obliged humble servant,<br/>
<span class="smcap">Portland</span>.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>LORD TEMPLE TO THE DUKE OF PORTLAND.</p>

<p>Dublin Castle, May 1st, 1783.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My Lord</span>,</p>

<p>I am honoured with your Grace's letter of the 26th instant,
and must return my best thanks for the expressions of regard
with which you have noted my appointment of Mr. Coppinger,
and of Mr. Doyle, to the situations which they now hold, at
your Grace's recommendation, to which I have truly given the
earliest attention in my power.</p>

<p>It is really a misfortune to me to find that our political ideas
have so materially differed. I perfectly agree with your Grace in
wishing not to defend nor arraign, and shall therefore waive the
subject, as far as it regards the change in His Majesty's councils.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span></p>

<p>But I cannot help complaining in private, as I have uniformly
in public, that I have been singularly unfortunate in the treatment
which I have met with. I resigned on the 12th of
March, and that resignation was notorious to every one conversant
in public business, and the intention communicated to
your Grace on the 2nd of March. Notwithstanding this, I
understand that no person was recommended for this situation
in the formation of the new Ministry; nor from the date of
their acceptance did I receive any notification of the King's
acceptance of my office, nor any apology for the delay, nor any
request to remain till the new appointment or arrival of my
successor, nor any communication upon the very extensive
business of this kingdom, for which I have declined any
responsibility; but, on the contrary, I have been, under these
circumstances, detained in a situation without responsibility,
which was actually objected as a charge against Mr. Pitt, while
I have been labouring to disengage myself; and, ultimately, I
have received Lord Northington's appointment, dated on the
24th (two days after it had been communicated by every one
connected with Government to their friends), without one
line of the King's approbation of my conduct, in circumstances
and moments very critical, unless I am to interpret Lord
North's opinion on that subject, as the official notification of His
Majesty's satisfaction.</p>

<p>These circumstances, my Lord, have much galled me, because
they are personal; and because they are not necessarily connected
with the change of Government, and have laid me under the
necessity of resenting it by expressions very decisive, in my
despatch of the 24th; and your Grace will easily believe that
the period for my relief, fixed by Lord North for six weeks
hence, after a resignation on the 12th of March, has not much
soothed me. I shall regret any injury to the public service, but
I have my private feelings, and they will not suffer me to
remain in such a situation for such a time, even if the state of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
this kingdom justified such an addition to the absolute interregnum
which has existed now since the second week in
February: but at the moment in which I write I remain totally
uninformed upon any of the voluminous details which I have
submitted, and particularly upon the subject the most delicate
from every consideration which depends upon it, I mean the
Parliament, which stands for next Tuesday. These facts, which
I have shortly detailed, press strongly on my mind. I have
wished to show every attention to your Grace, from whom I
have experienced great kindness, and to reconcile my private
sensations to a treatment which I must think unjustifiable, and
which I totally separate from the great political considerations
which have guided our respective lives, and with which I doubt
not we are both equally satisfied. These considerations never
would for a moment have broken in upon private friendship and
regard, but it severely pains me to think that I have reason to
complain of the personal conduct of a Ministry in which your
Grace has taken so distinguished a part, and in which I must
conclude, from your letter to me, that the powers of
Government are solely invested in those who had the advantage
of being denominated the friends of the late Lord Rockingham.</p>

<p>I am to apologize to your Grace for the length of this letter,
but I cannot conclude it without thanking you for the
assurances of your regard and good-will.</p>

<p>I have the honour to be,<br/>
My Lord,<br/>
Your Grace's obedient humble servant,<br/>
N. T.</p></div>

<p>The despatch alluded to, dated 24th, officially addressed
to Lord North, stated in detail, and with equal earnestness
and decision, the just grounds of complaint here
repeated to the Duke of Portland. Mr. Grenville, having<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
no option in a matter of so much moment, and which
admitted of no pause or remedy, forwarded the despatch
to Lord North; although he would gladly have withheld
it, under an apprehension that it might expose Lord
Temple to injurious imputations, not only on the score
of impatience, but as desiring to throw obstacles in the
way of his successor. In the hope of averting the latter
supposition, Mr. Grenville visited Lord Northington, to
express on his part, and on that of Lord Temple, the
desire of placing the Government in his hands with
every possible advantage to his personal convenience and
the public service. This interview was attended with
the best result, so far as Lord Northington was concerned.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>MR. W. W. GRENVILLE TO LORD TEMPLE.</p>

<p>Pall Mall, April 28th, 1783.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Brother</span>,</p>

<p>Yesterday and this evening, I received your letters of the
21st and 24th instant.</p>

<p>With respect to the first, there is, I think, no need of saying
anything as to its contents, except that it appears to me most
clearly that the Bill passed as a measure of the new Government,
especially from the Duke of Portland's words, which I
took down and sent to you. In all events, however, it had
passed before I received your despatch relating to it; so that
the delivery of that could have been of no use either in
influencing their conduct in present, or affording room for
comments upon it in future.</p>

<p>The despatches contained in your packet of the 24th, I have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
this night sent to Lord North, conceiving, from the expressions
of your note, that I had no option whatever with respect to
them. If I had felt myself at liberty, I must own that I think
I should have hesitated about it; as Lord Northington is
formally announced, and consequently your main object, that
of a speedy release from your situation, will soon be accomplished
by the natural impatience he will feel to take, what you,
on the other hand, are so desirous to give him. All other
objects, that of marking to the King and to them your sense
of the personal incivility they have shown you, and that of
pointing out their scandalous inattention to the business of
Ireland, might have been attained by twenty other ways;
while I cannot but fear that this will be liable to the imputation
which they are so studiously endeavouring to fix upon
you, and which, of all others, I should think you would wish
to avoid&mdash;that of throwing additional difficulties in the way of
your successor. I am convinced nothing is farther from your
intention: his situation will already be much less easy than
every Englishman&mdash;and particularly every man who looks forward,
and probably at no very distant period, to a share in the
Government of the empire&mdash;must wish it. And even the
appearance of contributing to his difficulties will, I think,
hurt you here; at the same time, that it will give him an
opportunity of throwing upon your shoulders any want of
success which he may experience.</p>

<p>Upon these considerations, which I am sure you feel, and
which I trust you will excuse my stating, I think of leaving
my name with him to-morrow, and of expressing either to him
or to Wyndham, with civility, but at the same time with a
proper reserve (so as not to commit you or myself), my readiness
to give any information in my power which they may
wish to receive. If I see either of them to-morrow, I shall
most likely in a very few days be able to inform you, in person,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
of the probable day of your release. I look forward with much
impatience to our meeting. In the meantime,</p>

<p>Believe me, my dearest brother,<br/>
Ever most sincerely and affectionately yours,<br/>
W. W. G.</p>

<p>Upon reading this over, I find I have said nothing of the
House of Commons. Jemmy is not in town, and I own I
think the saying anything on the subject now (after Lord
North's appointment), would be so strong, that I am afraid
to venture upon it without his advice.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>MR. W. W. GRENVILLE TO LORD TEMPLE.</p>

<p>Pall Mall, April 29th, 1783.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Brother</span>,</p>

<p>I have this day seen Lord Northington. He entered a good
deal into your complaint with respect to their personal usage of
yourself, and said that as soon as the new Government were
appointed, they had written to express to you those wishes,
which every one felt, for your remaining; that your answer
to that had not been received till a few days before his acceptance;
and that they had written to notify to you the day of his
being to be declared, which had been postponed till to-morrow,
merely out of attention to you, in order that it might not take
place till you was apprized of it.</p>

<p>To this I answered, that I did not understand you had
received any other communication than the mere official notification
of Lord North's appointment; but that, be that as it
might, I was sure it would not alter (as it was a matter only
between Lord North and the other Ministers, and you) your
wishes to place the Government in your successor's hands with
every possible advantage.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span></p>

<p>We had a little more conversation, which turned entirely on
generals, with many expressions of personal civility on his
part; and that he intended to write to-morrow, immediately
after his being declared, to state to you the time which he
desired for his preparations, &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

<p>Pitt spoke to Lord Bulkeley the other day, to express how
much he admired your conduct and character, particularly in
remaining so long; and that you were the person to whom the
country looked for the first situations.</p>

<p>Adieu, my dear brother.<br/>
Ever most affectionately yours,<br/>
W. W. G.</p>

<p>Tom asked me to-day, whether you had mentioned anything
to me of your having received a letter from him.</p></div>

<p>This interview was followed by an immediate communication
from Lord Northington.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>LORD NORTHINGTON TO LORD TEMPLE.</p>

<p>St. James's Place, April 30th, 1783.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Lord</span>,</p>

<p>It is with much concern I find that your Excellency has not
been prevailed upon to continue in the execution of a Government
which all accounts agree, and universal opinion confirms,
your Excellency to have conducted with so much credit to
yourself and satisfaction to the country over which you have the
honour to preside. I could have hoped, that the many
honourable testimonies of regard given to you might have
produced other sentiments, and that the general wishes of the
country might have effected what the Administration here
might have attempted in vain. This, however, not having been
the case, I have it to notify to your Excellency, that the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
pressing instances of my friends have been able to overcome my
own apprehensions, and I have consented to accept the arduous
situation of becoming your Excellency's successor.</p>

<p>I have had the honour of being declared this day, by His
Majesty in Council, as the person to relieve your Excellency,
which, as I understand your wishes to be, that it should be as
soon as can be, with any tolerable convenience to the affairs at
home, and the settlement of my establishment in Ireland, I
shall forward as much as possible. I hope, therefore, to be able
to set off from here in a month from the day of my declaration,
at furthest, by a week after, which I understand will be about
the time you find necessary for the arrangement of your affairs,
and the soonest you would have been able to have gone from
hence.</p>

<p>I had the pleasure of a conversation the other day with
Mr. Grenville, who very politely acquainted me with your Lordship's
sentiments, and readiness to give every communication
which might be of service to a successor. These assurances I
was happy to receive, although I could entertain little doubt
that a man of your Lordship's honour and liberality of mind
would feel a pleasure and satisfaction in doing that which
others, not with the same liberality of sentiment, might
consider only as a duty upon them. I shall think myself much
obliged, and shall derive no small assistance from a communication
of your Lordship's active exertions and inquiries since
you have been in Ireland; and I make no doubt I shall find
many plans which it will be much for the interest of Ireland for
me to adopt and carry into execution.</p>

<p>I have the honour to be, with great truth,</p>

<p>My dear Lord,<br/>
Your most obedient humble servant,<br/>
<span class="smcap">Northington</span>.</p></div>

<p>Amongst the papers in Lord Temple's hand-writing,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
is the rough draft of a letter to Lord North, dated
May 2nd, complaining that he had received no answer
to his despatch of April 24th, although a messenger had
just arrived, bearing His Majesty's commands on the subject
of the Parliament. The terms of this letter show how
deeply he felt the neglect of the Administration, in reference
to the public interests involved in his resignation.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>LORD TEMPLE TO LORD NORTH.</p>

<p>Dublin Castle, May 2nd, 1783.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My Lord</span>,</p>

<p>The messenger who is this moment arrived with His Majesty's
commands upon the subject of the Parliament, has not brought
me one syllable in answer to my despatch of the 24th, so interesting
to my feelings. Your Lordship, I am certain, does not
propose to delay receiving His Majesty's commands upon the
many matters contained in it, and yet your total silence upon
it, and the very distant day to which the Parliament is prorogued
(for which measure the King's servants alone are
responsible), do not hold out to me that prospect of release,
which I still conceive, from every principle of public duty to
this kingdom, and from every personal consideration to me,
will not be delayed many days longer. I have sufficiently
pressed upon your Lordship's attention these reasons of my
conduct. I have only to add, that I have well considered the
alternative to which I may be driven, and must again remind
your Lordship, that in no contingency do I consider myself
responsible for any one of the consequences which may be the
result of the public inattention to this Government, under
which this high and important office has been left unfilled from
the formation of the new Government till the 24th ult., and
under which the same interregnum is, in your Lordship's
despatch of that date, held out for six weeks longer.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span></p>

<p>And I am the more particularly anxious for this answer, from
the heartfelt concern with which I wait for the notification of His
Majesty's sense of those assurances of attachment and dutiful
respect, which makes me solicitous that no part of my conduct
may be liable to misconstruction: to his wisdom I submit those
considerations, which touch so nearly the interests of this
kingdom, and to his justice, with all humility, those which are
personal to myself.</p>

<p>I have the honour to be,<br/>
N. T.</p></div>

<p>While this letter was on its way to London, it was
crossed by Lord North's answer to the despatch of the
24th, containing, in detail, the defence of the Government
on the numerous points pressed upon their attention by
the Lord-Lieutenant.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>LORD NORTH TO LORD TEMPLE.</p>

<p>Whitehall, May 5th, 1733.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My Lord</span>,</p>

<p>The anxiety which your Excellency felt in writing your letter
of the 24th of last month, cannot, I will venture to affirm,
possibly exceed my surprise at receiving it. Having, during
the very little time that I have been in office, made it my object
to return the most speedy answers to all your Excellency's
letters, and having had the good fortune in every instance to
convey the most favourable return all to your Excellency's wishes
and commands, you may well suppose that I must have been
much struck at reading your complaints of ill-treatment, indelicacy,
or something (whatever it may be) that deserves a
harsher name. If, in the course of my life, it had not been
frequently my lot to see very great offence taken upon very
slight causes, the terms of your Excellency's letter would have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
given me more uneasiness. But, upon a calm and dispassionate
review of your complaints, and of the conduct of His Majesty's
servants, I can, by no means, either in their name, or in my
own, plead guilty to the neglects and other misbehaviour which
your Excellency thinks proper to lay to our charge.</p>

<p>Your Excellency is of opinion, that His Majesty's servants
should have employed themselves in endeavouring to find a
successor to your Excellency from the receipt of your letter
of the 12th of March. If your Excellency will give yourself
the trouble to recollect the transactions of that period, you will,
I am sure, concur with me in opinion, that it would have been
the extreme of folly and presumption for any of His Majesty's
present servants to have treated upon this subject with any
person breathing before the 2nd of April, when they had the
honour of kissing His Majesty's hand. Long after the day of
the receipt of your Excellency's letter, it was perfectly uncertain
here, to whose hands His Majesty would commit the management
of his affairs; nay, your Excellency cannot be ignorant,
that, since that time, the expectations (and I doubt not the
hopes) of the public were fixed upon seeing your Excellency at
the head of the Administration.</p>

<p>The 2nd of April was, therefore, the first moment that any of
His Majesty's present servants could take any step towards the
nomination of a new Chief Governor of Ireland. From that
time measures for that purpose have been constantly pursued,
till the affair was finally settled, on the 24th of last month.
The various impediments which have arisen I need not mention
to your Excellency, but the fact is exactly as I have stated;
and, as the delay is not unprecedented, nor even very long, I
think it is not trespassing too much upon your Excellency's
candour to expect that you will believe my assertion.</p>

<p>In your last letter, your Excellency seems hurt, that the
London newspapers should have announced in Dublin the
appointment of the Earl of Northington two days before you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
received my letter. Whatever might have been the information
or the conjectures of the news-writers, I assure your Excellency
that I wrote within an hour after I received authentic information
of that appointment.</p>

<p>As to the total and absolute neglect of Irish considerations,
on which your Excellency expresses yourself so strongly, you
certainly cannot mean to allude to the ordinary and current
business (which has been regularly attended to, and has met
with the most speedy decision that each case would admit of),
but to some great commercial points, upon which your Excellency
had written at different times to the late Administration,
and which had not, as I collect from your Excellency's letter,
been considered, when they quitted His Majesty's service.</p>

<p>I well remember, that Lord Carlisle very fully and clearly
stated, very earnestly and repeatedly pressed, the demands of
Ireland, with respect to the refusal of Portugal to admit their
woollen goods. Lord Hillsborough, then Secretary of State,
urged the claim of Ireland with much zeal and perseverance in
his despatches to the Court of Portugal, and in his conferences
with the Portuguese Minister in London. What was done in
that business by the late Administration I know not: nothing
of that sort has yet come to my knowledge; but, during the
few days that we have been in office, the Secretary of State for
the Foreign Department has renewed this negotiation with
Monsieur de Pinto, and I doubt not but it will be pursued
with all the attention that so important a question deserves.
But it is singular, that His Majesty's present servants should
be criminated for not having finished in the first busy three
weeks of a new Administration what has been depending during
the two last Ministries, and, notwithstanding the efforts of one
of them at least, is by no means so far advanced as to promise
an immediate conclusion.</p>

<p>That the interests of Ireland should not be separated from
those of Great Britain in any commercial treaty with France<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
and Spain, and that they should be considered in every arrangement
with the United States of America, are important truths,
upon which your Excellency, with much propriety, lays a great
stress. They cannot be urged too often or too strongly; but
whether your Excellency has any particular measures to suggest
on these heads, or whether the late Administration, when they
signed the provisional articles, and projected the commercial
treaties with the House of Bourbon, had formed any detailed
and digested plan upon these principles, I am not informed;
but this is certain, that it would have been very hasty and rash,
for His Majesty's servants in the first hurry of a new arrangement,
before any commercial treaty is formed with America, or
the definitive treaties signed with France and Spain, to think
themselves capable of proposing a well-formed system of commerce,
adapted to the new situation of Great Britain with her
late and present dependencies.</p>

<p>Your Excellency will consider, that we came to the situations
we now possess, in the midst of a session of Parliament, with
almost all the material business of that session unfinished,
indeed, hardly begun, and that, besides Parliamentary affairs,
there never was a time in which the Executive Power was
occupied with a greater variety of complicated and important
questions.</p>

<p>Many of the matters to which your Excellency alludes, must
necessarily employ the attention of His Majesty's Ministers for
a long space of time. Your Excellency will, therefore, I hope,
judge of our exertions according to the capacities of ordinary
men, and not according to the rapidity of your Excellency's
conceptions, and the eagerness of your zeal for the prosperity of
Ireland.</p>

<p>I beg pardon for detaining your Excellency so long, but I
trust that what I have written may serve to justify me to your
Excellency, when I confess, that the heavy and severe censures<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
in your Excellency's letter have produced no other emotions in
my mind than those of astonishment.</p>

<p>I have the honour to be, with the greatest truth and respect, My Lord,<br/>
Your Excellency's most obedient humble servant,<br/>
<span class="smcap">North</span>.</p>

<p>Earl Temple, Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland</p></div>

<p>Perhaps "astonishment," after all, was the most convenient
refuge for Lord North, under the circumstances.
But it is clear, throughout the whole correspondence, that,
let the responsibility rest where it might, a delay&mdash;fraught
with the worst consequences to the repose of the kingdom&mdash;had
been suffered to take place, greatly detrimental to
the public service, and personally compromising to Lord
Temple. Lord North himself acknowledges that from
the 2nd to the 24th of April was consumed in the pursuit
of measures which ought to have been carried into
operation without delay. The new Ministry confess that
they were three weeks looking for a successor to Lord
Temple, instead of having come into office prepared to fill
that important vacancy at once. They could not plead
ignorance of Lord Temple's determination to retire; for he
had apprised the Duke of Portland that his mind was made
up before the coalition was formed. There was no
excuse for the protracted inconvenience&mdash;public and private&mdash;to
which Lord Temple was exposed, except the fact that
the Ministry, too eager in the chase of office, had accepted
the reins of Government before they were ready to undertake
its functions; and that it was not until the situation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
of Lord-Lieutenant had been offered to one nobleman after
another, they at last found a peer who was willing to
incur the hazard of serving under them in so responsible
a post. That Lord Temple should have expressed his
feelings strongly on this occasion, that he should have
complained warmly of the personal slight with which he
was treated, and that he should have represented with
earnestness the injury inflicted on the public service
throughout this harassing interregnum, was due equally to
his own character, and to the duty he owed to the King.
Instead of being enabled to relinquish office to his successor
with ease and satisfaction to both, the affair was so
hurried, that in the correspondence which ensued between
Lord Temple and Lord Northington, a tone of asperity
insensibly displaces the amicable dispositions with which
it opens, and shows that the political discord which had
been sown by the "unprincipled coalition," was not without
a damaging influence upon the private relations of
public men. Lord Temple, after sacrificing much of his
own personal feelings to adapt his withdrawal to the
convenience of Lord Northington, at last expressed his
resolution&mdash;at any risk of consequences&mdash;not to be in
Dublin on the 4th of June, the anniversary of the King's
birthday. To this point the correspondence, interspersed
with one or two letters from Lord North, is finally drawn.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>LORD TEMPLE TO LORD NORTHINGTON.</p>

<p>Dublin Castle, May 6th, 1783.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Lord</span>,</p>

<p>My former letter will have sufficiently stated to you my full
determination that my private feelings should not prevent me<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
from showing to you every personal regard, which is so much
your due. My line was long since adopted; and standing
upon public grounds, I could not yield to the honourable testimonies
which I have received, much less to any solicitations
from the King's servants, <i>if any such had been made</i>. But for
particular reasons I desire to assure you that, neither directly or
indirectly, have I received, since the hour of their appointment,
any such intimation, or any solicitation to continue in this
Government till after your appointment. For <i>that</i> attention I
should thank them, as I should not have conceived that they
could entertain any real wish that I should act with people with
whom I did not agree in general principles. But my complaint
is, that the kingdom has materially suffered by this delay; that
it still suffers; and that this consideration will not permit me
to remain, independently of the considerations of a personal
nature, which I strongly feel.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances, I must strongly press upon your
convenience. I feel it, and, with truth, I regret it, as a real
misfortune; for, from private friendship, I would do everything
which could mark my regard; but you will see, upon
your arrival, that I have not exaggerated the difficulties of the
country under such an interregnum. I accept your expressions
of esteem, as I should, with every wish to return them by real
services. I think that I have the means of assisting you by
information, and you may command me; but I must be
relieved before the 25th of May, for reasons which involve my
public character and credit; and when I fix that period, I
assure you, my dear Lord, that I sacrifice much of my private
feelings to a desire of accommodating you. In truth, I wish to
you every success in your undertaking; and I feel a most
unpleasant difficulty in the present moment, from my private
sensations with respect to you, and the other principles, public
and private, which make me appear to fail in attention to you.
This is my only uneasiness. But at all events, let me continue<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
to stand well in your regards. As to every article of domestic
accommodation, much time might be spared if you would
commission our friend Baugh, or send your steward to Ireland.
In all this, do as you will; but be assured that</p>

<p>I am, my dear Lord,<br/>
Your very faithful and obedient servant,<br/>
(Signed) <span class="smcap">Nugent Temple</span>.</p>

<p>P.S.&mdash;When I fix the 25th of May, I allow one month from
the day of the notification of your acceptance&mdash;a time, I
confess, short; but, in truth, I was prepared within that
period. At all events, though I mean to urge that day in my
despatches to Government, all that I am anxious about is to be
relieved before the 4th of June, as you will see particular
reasons of delicacy for my not holding that Court. And when
you recollect that from the 17th of February the Government
of Ireland has been nearly at a stand, you will see the necessity
of it in a public point of view; and be assured, that personal
impatience or want of regard to you has no share in the
resolution which I have taken not to be in Ireland upon that
day.</p>

<p>Your Lordship will derive little advantage from the communication
of my ideas on the subject of Parliament, as the
Cabinet, by their prorogation, have decided that arduous
question; but be assured, that I have every inclination to show
to you every attention of that nature; although I must think
that the conduct of the Cabinet has acquitted me of every <i>duty</i>
of communication.</p>

<p>I have added this postscript, having kept my letter one day,
expecting Mr. Grenville. I must now close it, with every
expression of regard and esteem.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>MR. W. W. GRENVILLE TO LORD TEMPLE.</p>

<p>Pall Mall, May 7th, 1783.</p>

<p>By Lord Northington's Messenger.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Brother</span>,</p>

<p>I understand from Lord Northington, whom I saw to-day,
that both he and Lord North write to you this evening on the
subject of his departure, which I understand to be fixed for the
beginning of June.</p>

<p>I had some conversation with him on the subject, in which I
enlarged upon the ideas of your letter, your personal good-will
and wishes for his success, the mischief of the delay, and the
difficulties of your situation; and particularly stated the circumstances
of Ireland with respect to its army, to the Fencibles,
and to the different points of commerce which call for the
immediate interposition of Government, and which we meant to
have settled by having a Parliament sitting at this time, if
things had gone on as they were. His observations on all this
you will, I suppose, receive to-night.</p>

<p>I am in some doubt what to do about coming over to you,
as, on account of the Prince's death, there is no lev&eacute;e to-day,
nor, I fear, on Friday. If there is, I will set out that evening.
It is the more unfortunate, as I wished to know the King's
ideas as to your coming away. Your provocation is certainly
very great; yet I cannot help fearing that such a step will hurt
you here. I still wish to see the King, and will try it, if I
can.</p>

<p>Pitt's motion comes on to-day; but nobody knows it, though
it is imagined to go only to fifty or one hundred Knights, and
to some enlargement of boroughs, to take place only on proof
of delinquency, as in the case of Cricklade and Shoreham.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span></p>

<p>No news of any Dutch peace, nor can I guess why we are
arming, as is said to be the case; but query. Adieu.</p>

<p>Ever yours,<br/>
W. W. G.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>LORD NORTHINGTON TO LORD TEMPLE.</p>

<p>St. James's Place, May 7th, 1783.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Lord</span>,</p>

<p>Your despatch of the 29th of April, afforded me no small
degree of pleasure, as it conveyed to me such flattering
assurances of your Lordship's esteem and regard; sentiments
perfectly similar to which, I beg to assure your Lordship I
entertain for you, with the utmost sincerity and attachment.
I feel likewise, with much satisfaction and gratitude, those
kind and liberal offers of information and communication upon
all points which may tend to give me an early knowledge of
the state and situation of that country, and shall hope from
such assistance to be the better enabled to encounter the many
difficulties and embarrassments which I already foresee against
my Administration. I sincerely wish it was in my power to
answer that part of your Lordship's letter upon the subject of
my speedy departure, as you wish; but although on many
accounts, both of a public and private nature, some delay is
unavoidable, it is my wish and my intention, as far as concerns
myself, that a delay of a moment shall not be created, that is
not of absolute necessity for my own indispensable convenience.
Some attention is likewise necessary to His Majesty's servants,
whose time is now so much employed in the parliamentary
discussion of many subjects of great importance. The many
objects which claim much consideration, as stated in your
Excellency's despatches, and which have been pressed so
frequently, and urged so forcibly by your Lordship on His
Majesty's late servants, and which appeared to them so weighty<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
in themselves, and of such moment as to require so long a time
for deliberation, cannot be suddenly and easily resolved upon by
Ministers of so short a date in office, and with such a pressure
of public affairs upon them, occasioned by a discontinuance of
any active or responsible Government for such a period, for
which they cannot be in the least responsible.</p>

<p>I could, therefore, much wish your Lordship to believe, that
if, in the desire you have to be relieved, your wishes are not met
by me to the utmost, that you will not attribute it to any want of
a due exertion to remove the difficulties which obstruct my
compliance therewith, or the desire of staying here myself a
week longer; but that if I am enabled to overcome them sooner,
and His Majesty's Ministers are ready to give me their final
opinions earlier than I have expected they will be able to do,
that I shall embrace with pleasure an opportunity to relieve
your Lordship from a situation you feel so unpleasant and
irksome to you.</p>

<p>I have the honour to be, my dear Lord,<br/>
Your very faithful and obedient servant,<br/>
<span class="smcap">Northington</span>.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>LORD NORTH TO LORD TEMPLE.</p>

<p>Whitehall, May 9th, 1783.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My Lord</span>,</p>

<p>Your Excellency may be assured that it is not the wish of
His Majesty's servants on this side of the water to detain your
Excellency in Ireland a moment longer than the time that will
be necessary for your Excellency's successor so to arrange his
business here, as to be able to relieve your Excellency in your
Government.</p>

<p>Since the receipt of your Excellency's letter of the 29th of
last month, I have shown to the Earl of Northington all your
letters respecting your earnest desire of quitting your present<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
situation without delay, and received yesterday from his Lordship
the letter which accompanies this packet. I have reason
to believe that his Lordship is endeavouring to get himself
ready for his departure, with all possible diligence. His letter
will best explain to your Excellency when he expects to set out
for Dublin.</p>

<p>Your Excellency, in one part of your letter, seems hurt, that
mine of the 24th of last month did not convey, in terms sufficiently
explicit, a communication of His Majesty's gracious
acceptance and approbation of your Excellency's services.
Your Excellency certainly may infer, not only from that letter,
but from the whole tenor of my correspondence, that your
Administration of Ireland is approved by His Majesty; and
having substantially conveyed the royal sentiments on that
subject, I hope that I shall stand excused by your Excellency,
if I should not have used any particular form of words, though
it might have been more proper on the occasion, and more
agreeable to your Excellency's wishes.</p>

<p>I have the honour to be, with the greatest truth and respect, My Lord,<br/>
Your Excellency's most obedient humble servant,<br/>
<span class="smcap">North</span>.</p>

<p>Earl Temple, Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>LORD NORTHINGTON TO LORD TEMPLE.</p>

<p>St. James's Place, May 16th, 1783.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My Lord</span>,</p>

<p>The last letter which I had the honour of receiving from your
Lordship has very sufficiently stated the determinations you are
come to with regard to your stay, and that your resolution is
fixed, at <i>all events</i>, not to be in Dublin on the 4th of June.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
I must confess myself perfectly at a loss to conceive what those
<i>particular reasons of delicacy</i> may be, which appear to have
made such weighty impression on your Lordship's mind, so as
to have produced this resolution; but as the consequence will
be the placing the Government of the country in other hands,
and is a measure which does not seem to meet with the approbation
of His Majesty, I shall think it my duty (however
greatly my convenience must be the sacrifice) to attend, to the
utmost of my power, to His Majesty's wishes, that such an event
may not take place.</p>

<p>It is my purpose, therefore, to relieve your Excellency from
your Government, as you desire, before the 4th of June, and to
be in Dublin on that day, under circumstances the most
unpleasant and mortifying, an half-formed household, and the
impossibility of being able to pay that respect and reverence
which is due to the happy event of that day. It is my intention
to quit London on the 28th or 29th instant, and to make
it a point to be at Holyhead early on the 1st of June, so that if
the wind is fair and the tide should serve, I may be in Dublin
that night.</p>

<p>I cannot too frequently return my thanks to your Lordship
for the very kind and friendly intentions you have of affording
me every communication in your power, and of allowing me to
derive every assistance I can from your Lordship's great knowledge
of the country, its interests, and the view of its parties and
leading men. It will be with the greatest pleasure I shall ever
receive any instance of your Lordship's regard, and I am sure
none can be more agreeable, or of more importance to me, than
this will be.</p>

<p>With regard to the articles of domestic accommodation, I
shall reserve the discussion of them to Sir Willoughby Acton
and Mr. Fremantle. Sir Willoughby proposes to set out for
Dublin on Monday next, and is so obliging as to undertake this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
trouble for me. He will have the honour of paying his respects
to your Excellency, if you will give him leave.</p>

<p>I have the honour to be, my dear Lord,<br/>
Your most obedient and faithful humble servant,<br/>
<span class="smcap">Northington</span>.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>LORD NORTH TO LORD TEMPLE.</p>

<p>Whitehall, May 17th, 1783.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My Lord</span>,</p>

<p>Upon the receipt of your Excellency's letters of the 9th and
10th of this month, I took immediately every step in my
power that might forward your Excellency's wishes, and have
now the satisfaction of informing your Excellency that Lord
Northington will not fail to be at Holyhead on the 1st day of
next month; and I am commanded by His Majesty to express
to your Excellency his wish, that you will not quit the Government
of Ireland before the arrival of Lord Northington.
Although your Excellency will, according to this arrangement,
be detained a few days longer than the 25th of the present month,
yet I hope that the time fixed by Lord Northington is not so
remote as to cause any public or private inconvenience.</p>

<p>By my letter of the 9th instant, I flatter myself that I have
removed the uneasiness which your Excellency has expressed
more than once, because His Majesty's approbation of your
Excellency's Government has not been notified in a manner the
most agreeable to your Excellency. I am sure that when you
read that letter, your Excellency was convinced that your
former complaint was ill-founded; that His Majesty's gracious
approbation of your Excellency's conduct has been substantially
conveyed to your Excellency; and that there is nothing in the
whole tenor of my letters which can justify your Excellency's
opinion, that a total change of system is to be adopted both<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
with regard to the Chief Governor, and the measures of Government
in Ireland.</p>

<p>I have the honour to be, with the greatest respect, My Lord,<br/>
Your Excellency's most obedient humble servant,<br/>
<span class="smcap">North</span>.</p>

<p>P.S.&mdash;The messenger carries three letters from Lord Northington&mdash;one
to your Excellency, one to Lieutenant-General
Burgoyne, and another to General Baugh.</p>

<p>His Excellency the Earl Temple, &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>LORD NORTHINGTON TO LORD TEMPLE.</p>

<p>St. James's Place, May 25th, 1783.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Lord</span>,</p>

<p>Your Excellency has not been able to remove those unpleasant
and mortifying ideas I entertain at the thoughts of being
obliged to pay either no attention to a day, to which all
honour and respect is due, or to do it in a manner unbecoming,
and not suitable to the occasion. Indeed, my information by
numerous Irish gentlemen now here, tells me that, although it
may not be expected that I should give (what your Lordship says)
<i>a dinner</i> on the occasion, it will be expected I shall hold a
Court, and that I shall give a ball. Then I understand likewise,
from your letters, as you declare your positive and fixed
resolution not to hold a <i>Court</i> on that day in the despatch, the
last but one which I had the honour to receive, and that from
strong reasons of delicacy, both public and private, which, as
your Excellency does not explain, at this distance and in my
state of ignorance at present I am at a loss to conceive.</p>

<p>I have the honour to be, my dear Lord,<br/>
Your faithful and obedient humble servant,<br/>
<span class="smcap">Northington</span>.</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span></p>

<p>Lord Temple's administration was too brief to enable
him to develop the plans he had laid down for the benefit
of Ireland; but the most conclusive testimony that can be
adduced in favour of his policy is the assurance he received
from Lord North, that no intention of deviating from it
was entertained by the new Ministers. Although, however,
Lord Northington did not openly deviate from the
main points of his policy, he followed it up with a luke-warmness
and insincerity that rendered it to a great
extent inoperative. His Lordship appears to have betrayed,
not only in his measures, but in the spirit and
tone in which they were brought forward, an unworthy
desire to discredit the influence and reputation of his
predecessor, who pursued a line of conduct after he left
Ireland which&mdash;putting aside all obligations to the public&mdash;entitled
him at least to protection against such sinister
attempts to undermine the confidence his zealous services
had acquired. Having resigned the Government
into the hands of Lord Northington, to whom he frankly
offered all the assistance and information his experience
enabled him to bestow, he strictly avoided all interference
in Irish affairs that might be likely&mdash;even remotely&mdash;to
embarrass his successor. Numerous applications were
made to him on a variety of subjects; individuals and
parties sought his advice and interposition; but he made
the same answer to all&mdash;referring them at once to the
established authority, and declining to use any influence,
upon the most trifling occasions, which in his position he
might have legitimately exercised. His magnanimity was
thrown away upon a thankless soil. The situation he had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
filled with so much honour and advantage, was now occupied
by a nobleman who could neither appreciate nor
imitate his lofty example.</p>

<p>The principal objects to which Lord Temple had
directed his attention were the Bill of Renunciation, and
a wise economy in the public expenditure. The former
he carried; the latter it was impossible to consolidate in
the short term of six months. In his indefatigable labours
for the good of Ireland he never stooped to conciliate faction
at the cost of duty, or the sacrifice of principle. He
administered his high office to promote the interests, and
not to pander to the passions of the people. The Bill
of Renunciation was said to have been a scheme of
Mr. Flood's; but by taking charge of it himself, Lord
Temple deprived it of the mischievous <i>prestige</i> it might
have acquired under such dangerous auspices. The Bill,
however, was not Mr. Flood's. Whatever merit, or
demerit attaches to it, belongs exclusively to Lord Temple.
Lord Northington, overlooking the fact that this Bill was
simply a confirmation of the settlement of 1782, and that
it really granted nothing new, endeavoured to make it a
fulcrum for working further changes and more extensive
concessions&mdash;not, it may be presumed, without an indirect
view to the improvement of his own popularity. The
mode in which he thus proposed to carry out Lord
Temple's policy provoked the Government, at last, to
remonstrate with him. Even Mr. Fox, who could not be
suspected of any disinclination to give a patient hearing
to Irish demands, seeing the part he had already taken on
such questions, felt it necessary to check his exuberant<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
zeal on behalf of the particular party, whose views and
opinions he had so injudiciously adopted. On the 8th of
November, he wrote to Lord Northington an admonishing
letter upon a variety of points connected with Irish affairs,
towards the conclusion of which he observed:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I hope, my dear Northington, you will not consider this long
letter as meant to blame your conduct; but I think I owe it
as much to my friendship for you as to the public, to give you
fairly my opinion and advice in your most arduous situation;
and I will fairly own there is one principle which seems to run
through your different <i>despatches</i>, which a little alarms me: it
is this&mdash;you seem to think as if it were absolutely necessary at
the outset of your Government, to do something that may
appear to be obtaining <i>boons</i>, however trifling, to Ireland; and
what I confess I like still less, is to see that this is, in some
degree, grounded upon the ampleness of former concessions.
Now I see this in quite a different light, and reason that,
because these concessions were so ample, no further ones are
necessary. If, because the Duke of Portland gave much, are
you to give something? Consider how this reasoning will
apply to your successor. I repeat it again, the account must
be considered as closed in 1782.<a name="FNanchor_1_7" id="FNanchor_1_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_7" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_7" id="Footnote_1_7"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_7"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> Extracted from a letter published in the Life of Mr. Grattan.</p></div>

<p>It may be observed, <i>en parenth&egrave;se</i>, that the assertion
that the Duke of Portland gave much, is a gratuitous
assumption. When his Grace came into office, he found
the Renunciation Bill passing through its last stages, and
he suffered it to pass; but, as Mr. Fox states in this very
letter, with the utmost reluctance. The Duke of Portland,
in fact, gave nothing. He submitted to the measure
of his predecessors because he could not avoid it, and he
would have retreated from it if he could.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span></p>

<p>No useful result would be gained by a comparison
between the intelligible principles and consistency evinced
by Lord Temple in his government of Ireland, and the
small views and tremulous policy of his successor; but
it is something to the purpose of history to note that,
while Lord Northington affected to adopt the economical
system of Lord Temple, he secretly desired to stultify it,
and that so far from being actuated by any sentiment of
respect for the government of his predecessor, he suffered
the motions of thanks which both Houses of Parliament
voted to Lord Temple, when they met in the following
October, to pass without a solitary expression of approval
on the part of any member of the Administration. These
facts are somewhat indignantly stated in a letter addressed
to Lord Temple, by Lord Mornington, on the 18th of
October, 1783. Respecting the vote of thanks, his Lordship
observes:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Government had not the spirit to take a part against the
motions of thanks in either House, <i>but I have every reason to
think that they would have done it, if there had been the
smallest prospect of success in the attempt</i>. You must observe
that the vote of the House of Commons is much weaker than
that of the Lords; Gardiner was obliged, by the interference of
Government's friends, to omit several expressions which, if they
had been retained, would have rendered the vote more just to
your Lordship's Administration, but would have occasioned
debate. The fact is, that no compliment to the Act of Renunciation,
or even to the framer of it, can be borne with patience
by certain supporters of the present Castle.</p></div>

<p>And in the report of his own speech on this occasion,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
which accompanies the letter, Lord Mornington plainly
charges the Government with duplicity in reference to
Lord Temple's system of economy. Referring to a passage
in the Lord-Lieutenant's speech, where his Excellency,
in recommending the establishment of the Genevans,
reminded Parliament of their duty to "avoid <i>unnecessary
expense</i>," his Lordship expresses a hope that in "other
cases, where all profusion would be dangerous, and where
the public safety demanded the most rigid economy, <i>in the
establishments of Government, his Excellency would think
it</i> <span class="smcap">his</span> <i>duty to avoid all unnecessary expense</i>;" and then,
comparing the recommendation respecting the Genevans
with another passage where his Excellency applied for a
supply, and in which "his Excellency's economy made no
appearance," Lord Mornington goes on to say:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Comparing the two passages of the speech, he [Lord Mornington]
was apt to imagine that the expression, "unnecessary
expense," was dictated by another spirit, and with other views,
than of saving to the public: he suspected that it was meant
to insinuate by so special, and seemingly superfluous a recommendation
of economy in the further progress of the establishment
of the Genevans, that there had been some neglect of
economy in the original foundation of the scheme; if that was
meant, he called upon the confidential servants of the Castle to
avow it; if not, he insisted that they should do justice to the
personage who had originally framed this plan, and disclaim his
construction of this ambiguous phrase. <i>He knew what had
been the language of the Castle on this subject; he knew how
this scheme had been decried; and what a damp had been cast
upon the proposers of it</i>&mdash;such a damp, as he had reason to
believe, that the settlement had not advanced one step since the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
departure of Lord Temple; and he would add, in justice both
to the late and present Ministry, that he, in his conscience,
believed, if the public were put to any <i>unnecessary expense</i> by
the settlement, <i>it must be attributed solely and entirely to the
delays and impediments which had been thrown in its way by
the present Castle</i>.</p></div>

<p>On a subsequent day, moving the thanks of the House
to Lord Temple, Lord Mornington delivered an eloquent
panegyric upon his Government. He spoke of the Act of
Renunciation as having produced an "instantaneous calm
in Ireland," and, adverting to other matters, observed:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>These were the great public acts of Lord Temple's Government,
the nation at large had felt their effects, the Lord-Lieutenant
had from the throne applauded them; the House
itself had applauded them in detail, and therefore would not
object to doing so in the gross, which he now called upon the
House to do. With regard to the general attention of Lord
Temple to the common duties of his office, and his management
of the interior system of government here, he would deliver no
opinion of his own; he would appeal to those whose high
stations and confidential offices gave them constant access to
the person and councils of Lord Temple, to testify his ability
and assiduity in business, the extent of his researches, the
vigilance with which he penetrated into the secrets of departments
where the most gross rapine and peculation had been
practised for ages with impunity, <i>and particularly the firm
integrity with which he resisted all jobs, however speciously concealed,
or powerfully recommended</i>.</p></div>

<p>Nothing need be added to this unimpeachable eulogium
on the character of Lord Temple's administration of the
Government of Ireland. It comes from an authority<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
above suspicion, and its statements will guide the decisions
of history.</p>

<p>In the midst of these political anxieties there was a
private grief, arising out of the sundering of attachments
consequent upon the unnatural state of parties, that preyed
severely on the sensitive mind of Lord Temple. This
painful matter forms the subject of a letter from Lord
Temple to his brother, Mr. Thomas Grenville, which
has not been inserted in its chronological place, as it
would have interrupted the sequence of the preceding
correspondence. The tender and affectionate feelings
hitherto subsisting unimpaired between the brothers, who,
in addition to the rest of their noble qualities, were distinguished
beyond most men by their domestic virtues, had
been interrupted by one of those fatal divisions in public
life, which, during this memorable crisis, separated the
closest friends.</p>

<p>The particular occasion which now for the first time produced
disunion between Lord Temple and his brother, is
not expressly stated in the letter; but it may be surmised
from the correspondence which took place early in the preceding
year between Mr. Thomas Grenville and Mr. Fox,
when the former was employed upon the American negotiation
in Paris. Mr. Thomas Grenville, devoting himself
to the interests of Mr. Fox, still preserved his allegiance to
him under the arrangements of the Coalition Administration;
and, from certain expressions in this letter, it would
appear that he had ventured to make some overture to
Lord Temple, with a view to induce him to reconsider the
line of action he had resolved upon, if indeed it did not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
amount to the distinct proposal of an office under the
new Ministry. The exact nature of that offer is veiled
under the language of a poignant and bitter regret, which
seeks to avoid details the writer was most unwilling to
enter into; but it is sufficiently explicit as to the "new
connection" Mr. Thomas Grenville had formed, in an
opposite direction to that which Lord Temple's devotion
to the principles they held in common had led him to
embrace. The sensibility manifested by Lord Temple in
reference to this unhappy affair, shows that his heart
was as impressionable as his judgment was clear and
firm.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>LORD TEMPLE TO MR. THOMAS GRENVILLE.</p>

<p>Ph&oelig;nix Lodge, May 9th, 1783.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Brother</span>,</p>

<p>Your letter, which mentions one written some time since,
came yesterday to my hands; and upon the same day came a
monthly account from Coutts, by which I see that, by Welles's
neglect, and by the delay of my stewards, I had unknowingly
drawn for the expenses of my departure beyond my state; but
as it is proper that your wants should be supplied, I have writ
to Frogatt, to order him to let you have some &pound;500 from some
money of mine in his hands; and I will let you have more as
soon as I can.</p>

<p>The remainder of your letter gives me, indeed, the most
sensible concern, for it shows me that line broken, which I
was still in hopes was only strained; for this is the only
interpretation which I can put upon that offer, which (from the
most honourable motives) you have made to me; and the only
wish which I can now form, is that you may never reflect for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
whom, and for what, you have sacrificed that political and
intimate connexion, which nature had pointed out, and which
till this moment I had not despaired of. One opportunity
presented itself in which you could have done me essential
service: I never can regret the eagerness with which I
entreated from you that proof of affection, because I still feel
how much I would have sacrificed, to have preserved our bond
inviolate; that, with many other prospects, is now gone, and
I am to feel that I have lost that confidence, that good-will and
attachment which you have given to a friendship, which, for
obvious reasons, I must ever regret. I do not speak this in
resentment and reproach, my feelings are far above them, but
in sober and earnest grief of mind. I must remind you that
no personal friendship, no party or political consideration,
could have guided the steps which I took in June last; to
which, in terms the most decisive, you marked your line of
separation. The same public principles (for with no one person
in England have I correspondence) have decided me in the
present moment, and in neither path have we met; and
parting upon such a question as that of the present system
(upon which I feel everything as a public man, and as a
private man have the sensations which naturally result from
personal insult), I fear that we have (at least for some time)
little chance of seeing those affections vibrate in unison which I
feel so strongly strained. Once more let me entreat you (for I
am not ashamed to entreat) to reconsider this well. If your
new connexion replaces to you that affectionate interest which
from my childhood I have borne to you; if your line holds out
to you that honourable satisfaction, which I trust you would not
have lost by a cordial union of objects and dispositions with
me, I fear that I speak in vain; but if you give that play to
your reason, to your affection, and to every feeling which
Providence has given, as the cement of the tenderest and most<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
intimate connexions, remember that in offering to you my
heart, I mean to offer to you everything which the truest love
can give you, but what must and can depend only on the
closest union. Weigh this well, and may every good angel
guide your decision. Adieu.</p></div>

<p>Lord Temple must have been the more distressed by
the course his brother had taken on this occasion, from
the evidences he received of the sanction of other
friends, who were governed in their own conduct by his
example. These proofs of attachment and approval, while
they afforded the most gratifying testimony to the rectitude
of his views, touched him deeply in contrast with the
alienation of his brother.</p>

<p>Only a few days before he wrote this letter to Mr.
Thomas Grenville, we find Lord Bulkeley addressing him
in the following terms, alluding to the communication
in which Lord Temple had informed him of his determination
to resign. "I had great pleasure," observes
the writer, "in receiving your last very kind letter,
and in learning from yourself the line you meant to
take at a critical conjuncture like the present, when
the candidates for honour and principle are so reduced
in number, that those who forego great situations to
bring them forward again, have every title to confidence
and support, and deserve every honest and independent
encouragement. You may naturally suppose I have
not been without solicitations from the Coalition Government;
I have given but one answer, which was that
I shall certainly act with you, and more especially as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
your conduct in resigning gave me, if possible, a greater
opinion of and veneration for your character than I could
by any means express."</p>

<p>Such testimonies were consolatory in the difficult position
in which Lord Temple was placed; but, instead of
alleviating the pain he felt at his separation from his
brother in public life, they embittered it by the conviction
that one whom he loved so sincerely should have adopted
a line of action which he in his conscience believed to be
erroneous.</p>

<p>It will be observed that in writing to Mr. Thomas
Grenville, Lord Temple alludes to a former letter, which
evidently had not reached its destination. The circumstance
would be unimportant in itself, were there not
reason to believe that it formed part of a regular system
of <i>espionnage</i> to which the whole of Lord Temple's
correspondence was subjected. The establishment of such
an inquisition into the letters of so high a functionary
as the Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland seems incredible, and
nothing short of the most decisive proofs of the fact could
justify even a suspicion of its existence. But there are
passages in these letters which leave no doubt whatever
that Lord Temple's correspondence, both private and
public, was inspected in London while he yet held office in
Ireland, and that the same course continued to be carried
on after he returned to England. Nor was the <i>espionnage</i>
limited to mere perusal, frequent allusions to miscarriages
leading to the inference that his letters were sometimes
suppressed altogether.</p>

<p>There are no means of determining with whom this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
system originated. All that appears to be certain is, that
it was practised during the period of the Shelburne
Cabinet, and followed up under the Coalition; and that
after it had been detected, no secret was made about it,
either by Lord Temple or his intimate correspondents.</p>

<p>Writing to Colonel Dundas, Lord Temple says, apparently
under the apprehension that his letter would be
read by others, "Obvious circumstances will prevent my
going into the discussion of details in a post letter." And
to a friend in Ireland, he speaks still more explicitly:
"As almost every letter," he observes, "received or written
by me is opened, it is possible that this may undergo that
operation in London; and if so, they will learn the real
regard I bear to you." Mr. Cuff, writing to Lord
Temple, from Dublin, in the November of this year,
declares that he expects nothing less than that his letter
will be opened and read. The passage is too remarkable
to be omitted.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I should not now trouble your Lordship with a letter, but
that I find to a certainty, that letters to and from your Lordship
are not only opened and read, but many of them are stopped.
If this should happen to get into your Lordship's hands, you
will see, by what I have written on the outside of it, that I am
willing to compromise with those <i>honourable gentlemen</i> who
open and read your letters, and that I have no objections to
their opening and reading, provided they will afterwards forward
them to you.</p>

<p>Your Lordship mentions a letter you wrote to me about three
or four weeks since, relative to the Genevois and their houses.
I have never received a letter from your Lordship since you left
Ireland, except one dated the 20th of July, and your last of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
23rd of October. I had the honour to write to your Lordship
about the 20th or 25th of September, thanking you for your
letter of the 20th of July, and telling you (what I can say with
truth) that I prize it more than all my other possessions upon
earth. I did not know, when I wrote that letter, that it would
be opened and read, else I should have declared my sentiments
more freely; but as I am almost certain that this one will be
opened, I shall be more full.</p>

<p>Know all men, therefore, by these presents, openers of letters,
and others, that I am more attached to your Lordship than to
all the rest of the world; not because you gave me a place of
&pound;400 a year at the Barrack Board, but because I think you
have more sense, honour, and firmness, than all the Viceroys I
have ever seen in Ireland put together.</p></div>

<p>A month elapsed before Lord Temple answered this
letter, unwilling to trust his reply to the post, and waiting
all that time for an opportunity to send it by a "safe
hand." His explanation of the delay furnishes additional
proof of the inquisition to which his correspondence was
exposed.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I should long since (he observes) have acknowledged your
very kind letter to me, if I had not delayed it partly with the
inclination of sending you an answer by a safe hand, and
partly from the exceeding anxious state of public business,
which has wholly engrossed my attention. It appears from
your state[ment] of the letters which you have received, that
one, written about the beginning of October, never reached
you.</p></div>

<p>That Lord Temple's letters should have been secretly
inspected by a hostile Administration is intelligible, if we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
can admit such a proceeding to be consistent with the
honour of public men or reconcilable with the obligations
of the public service; but it is impossible to comprehend
upon what ground of expediency or from what motives
of jealousy or distrust, so flagrant a breach of confidence
was committed towards him by the subordinates (for it
is difficult to believe it could have been officially sanctioned
by Ministers themselves) of a Cabinet under which
he held so responsible a situation as that of the Vice-royalty
of Ireland. The fact, nevertheless, admits of no
doubt, and throws a strong light on the sinister means
which were adopted in those days for the "management"
of the executive.</p>

<p>The share which Lord Temple took in public affairs
after his return from Ireland, and during the existence
of the Coalition, naturally enough made him a special
object of suspicion and resentment to the Cabinet. We
find him, in his letter to Mr. Cuff, stating that his
attention has been wholly engrossed by the anxious state
of public business, and the memoirs of the period show
in the results how powerfully he contributed to the overthrow
of that ministerial combination, which he had
denounced as unnatural and infamous. But the details
of his services to the King throughout this harassing crisis
have never found their way into history; nor is it now
possible, from their secret and confidential nature, to trace
them in full. The disclosures, however, which may be
gleaned from the few letters that passed to and from
Lord Temple at this period, sufficiently prove that the
King trusted all along to his counsel and support, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
acted altogether on his advice. There was so much
hazard in committing opinions and suggestions to so
unsafe a medium as that of correspondence, that we can
look but for scanty revelations in the papers which have
been preserved. It appears that Lord Temple conducted
his proceedings in reference to the struggle between the
King and his Ministers chiefly by means of personal interviews
and detached memoranda of his views, intended
only to assist the memory in conversation, and torn up
as soon as used. Lord Thurlow was sometimes employed
by his Majesty as an agent on these occasions, and
through him, probably to avert suspicion from the real
quarter on which his Majesty relied, the intercourse with
Lord Temple and his friends was occasionally carried on.</p>

<p>From the commencement to the close of the brief
tenure of the Coalition, his Majesty held aloof from his
Ministers; and it was not till the opening of the Session,
on the 11th of November, that an opportunity was presented
for acting effectively upon his determination to
get rid of them as soon as he could. During the interval
that had elapsed since the prorogation of Parliament in
the preceding July, they prepared their measures; but,
from the want of co-operation and confidence on the part
of the Sovereign, the precise character of their policy
was a matter of speculation outside the Cabinet. His
Majesty either did not, or would not, know the course
they intended to pursue; and it is evident, from subsequent
circumstances, that the plan of operations for
relieving him of their presence was kept in suspense,
waiting upon events, up to the moment when they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
brought forward their famous India Bill. The following
letter, written a few days before the opening of Parliament,
shows how little was known at that moment of
the views of Ministers, and enables us to perceive that,
although Lord Temple was in frequent communication
with the King, he had not yet decided upon the line of
conduct to be adopted. The state of affairs implied in
the letter is curious enough; exhibiting the Sovereign,
on the one side, taking secret counsel of the Opposition,
and the Ministry, on the other, coming down to Parliament
with measures which they were well aware His
Majesty was eagerly watching for a constitutional excuse
to thwart and defeat.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>LORD TEMPLE TO LORD MORNINGTON.</p>

<p>Stowe, Nov. 6th, 1783.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Lord</span>,</p>

<p>As Stephen Fremantle will deliver this to you, I have not the
same difficulties which attend the writing a post letter. I go to
town to-morrow, in order to settle our winter arrangements.
My first principle will be to throw Ireland out of the book of
opposition, unless I am attacked upon it, which I sincerely hope
may be the case; although I have but little hopes that by any
management in either House, Ministry will be brought to
acknowledge the language which their agents uniformly hold
upon my subject. Their politics are, I own, inexplicable upon
Ireland; they speak the language of high crimination of me,
for the concession (which I call no concession) made in the last
sessions; they affect to talk loudly and strongly upon all subsequent
claims or popular subjects, and to have no fear upon
the event of any of those questions; and yet I know that Lord<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
Northington is frightened, and has uniformly proposed concession
on every point <i>to the fullest extent</i>; this communication
I know directly from the King's mouth, though not to me, but
to another person; consequently, it is for your private ear. It
is possible that Wyndham, the professed friend to Parliamentary
Reform, may have taken his resolution to resign upon that
measure being negatived, which we understand certainly to have
been decided here. But in all modes of turning it, how is it
possible to reconcile a heap of contradictions? I shall see the
King upon particular business (no idea of a change) on Friday;
and if with propriety I can state anything further upon this,
you shall know it. The Portugal business is really all afloat;
nor do Ministry see daylight; and I know, from undoubted
authority, that France, Spain, and Portugal mean to offer their
trade to Ireland upon lower terms, if you will dispense with
the Alien Duty, or, in so many words, with the Navigation
Act, which, <i>entre nous</i>, I fear is no longer binding upon you, as
we have partially repealed it in favour of America, and therefore,
under Yelverton's Bill, it is now void. This idea, I know, has
been proposed to some of your Irish factors, and I have reason
to believe that Government know nothing about it. The information
which I gave you upon the subject of the Treaties is likewise
authentic; it is certain that the commercial system with
any of the contracting parties is not advanced nor advancing:
so much then for your commercial code. As to the ideas of protecting
duties, East India trade, and such, &amp;c., as Ministry
affect, and I hope with truth, to hold them cheap; as to the
Absentee Tax, I do not hear what they propose; but from many
circumstances I should not wonder if they gave way; and if
they do, the mortal blow is struck to your landed interest. I
wish you would be so good as to inquire privately what became
of the prosecutions I had ordered against the Kilkenny Rangers
for their riot with Talbot's Fencibles, and against a Mr.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
Hetherington, Lieutenant of the Lowtherstown Volunteers
near Inniskillen, for firing with his corps upon a party of the
105th, who came to seize his stills; for I very much suspect
that Yelverton (who was very much averse to them) has
smuggled them all. I rather think that you must see Grattan
in opposition, as I do not see how he can fight under Scott or
Fitzgibbon, who have clearly undertaken the House of Commons.
If so, the restoration of Lord Carlisle's Administration
is singularly perfect in all its parts, except Sheridan, <i>vice</i> Lees,
which you will agree with me is not quite enough to constitute
an essential difference. If the Post-Office gives only one Post-Master
you will see Lord Northington completely puzzled, as I
have reason to think that the Duke of Leinster and old Mr.
Ponsonby have both asked for it. What do you suppose is in
contemplation about your Chancellor? I cannot think that
Lord Lifford will continue, and yet his terms (to which the
Duke of Portland had acceded in July, 1782,) are immoderately
high, viz., &pound;2,000 per annum for three lives. When you will
recollect that our late Chancellors, though going to the Woolsack
from high offices and emoluments, received&mdash;Lord Camden
&pound;1,500 a year Irish, till a Tellership fell; Lord Bathurst
nothing; Lord Thurlow a reversion of a tellership at &pound;3,000
per annum. Compare the pretensions and the rewards!</p>

<p>In this kingdom you will see that there is <i>de quoi s'amuser</i>
in Parliament: the Funds lower than in war; &pound;30,000,000 still
unfunded, consequently &pound;1,500,000, at the least, to be raised
of annual taxes, and at least &pound;500,000 or &pound;600,000 additional
taxes to make up the deficiencies. Nothing done in Reform,
except the creation of new offices, and the whole attention of
ministers exclusively turned to the book of Numbers. My
brother's fears were that the Opposition might be petulant.
With this bill of fare, and that which the foreign questions will
furnish, I do not think that we run great risk. Do not answer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
the detail of this letter, for it is unsafe; but I wished to take
every opportunity to give you good information, and to assure
you of the affectionate regard with which I am,</p>

<p>My dear Lord,<br/>
Ever yours,<br/>
N. T.</p></div>

<p>The East India Bills were introduced by Mr. Fox, on
the 18th of November. The extreme and almost unprecedented
principle laid down in these Bills, afforded His
Majesty and his private advisers the opportunity of resistance
they desired. Had the Opposition themselves framed
a measure for Ministers, with the express purpose of
widening the distance between the Cabinet and the Sovereign,
they could not have devised one better adapted to
the purpose. The main object of the East India Bills was
to withdraw from the Company the entire administration
of the civil and commercial affairs of India, and to vest it
in a board of commissioners, who should be nominated by
Parliament, and rendered perfectly independent of the
Crown. This scheme is said to have been devised by
Mr. Burke; but even the paternity of Mr. Burke could
not mitigate the odium that was heaped upon it by the
Pitt and Grenville party. Mr. Pitt described it as a
piece of tyranny that broke through every principle of
equity and justice, that took away the security of every
company in the kingdom, the Bank, the national creditor
and the public corporations, and that left unsafe the great
Charter itself, the foundation of all our liberties. It was
not merely, however, because it struck at the principle of
security so far as public companies and chartered rights<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
were concerned, that it incurred the strenuous opposition
of the King's friends. A more immediate objection was
discovered in the blow it aimed at the royal prerogative.
The establishment of a commission for the administration
of the affairs of India, without concert with the Crown,
and whose members were irremovable by the Sovereign,
except upon an address from either House of Parliament,
was a bold attempt to reduce and narrow the King's
influence, which, in the menacing relations then subsisting
between the Ministers and the King, could only be
regarded as a declaration of open hostility. Upon this
ill-considered measure the royal opposition took its stand.
But great difficulties were to be encountered before the
favourable opportunity thus afforded by the rashness of
Ministers could be turned to account.</p>

<p>The Bills passed triumphantly through the Commons,
the second reading being carried by a majority of 217
to 103; and on the 9th of December Mr. Fox, attended
by a numerous train of members, presented them at the
bar of the House of Lords. Here, then, the final battle
was to be fought. Lord Temple protested against the
measure as "infamous," and as seizing upon "the most
inestimable part of the Constitution&mdash;our chartered rights;"
and was energetically supported by Thurlow, Richmond,
and Camden. But as something more than the ordinary
parliamentary resistance was necessary to effect the rejection
at once of the plan and its authors, Lord Temple
obtained permission to make known the sentiments of His
Majesty on the subject, in order to give additional weight
and authority to the movements of the Opposition. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
proverb which has come down to us from Shakspeare,
that the King's name is a tower of strength, was never,
perhaps, more effectively illustrated.</p>

<p>According to the version which is given in the accounts
hitherto published of these transactions, it was not till the
11th of December, two days after the Bills had been
read a first time in the Lords, that His Majesty was
apprised of the real character of the measure as it affected
his prerogative; and it was then, and not till then, His
Majesty determined to resist it. This statement goes to
the effect&mdash;that on the 11th of December, between the
first and second reading, Earl Temple had a conference
with the King, in the course of which he fully explained
to His Majesty the nature and tendency of a measure
which His Majesty had up to that time approved; that
he showed His Majesty that he had been "duped" and
"deceived," and that His Majesty's indignation at this
discovery was excited to such a height as to induce him
to authorise the Earl Temple to oppose the Bills in his
name. In order to leave no doubt on this point, and
to give it all possible force and authenticity, a card was
written, setting forth, "That His Majesty allowed Earl
Temple to say, that whoever voted for the India Bill
was not only not his friend, but would be considered by
him as an enemy; and if these words were not strong
enough, Earl Temple might use whatever words he might
deem stronger and more to the purpose."</p>

<p>This unusual and rather undignified proceeding admits
of no other justification than the urgency and exigency
of the occasion; and the best thing that can be said<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
of it is, that it answered the end for which it was
designed, although the notoriety which was given to it
(and without which it would have been of no avail)
produced a fierce resolution in the Commons, carried by
an immense majority, declaring that it was a high crime
and misdemeanour to report any opinion or pretended
opinion of the King upon any proceeding depending in
either House of Parliament, with a view to influence the
votes of members. It did influence the votes of members
very extensively, nevertheless, several proxies which had
been entrusted to Ministers having been withdrawn in
consequence of the royal interference.</p>

<p>It would appear from this statement, that up to the
11th of December, His Majesty had approved of the India
Bills; and that on that day, for the first time, Lord
Temple drew His Majesty's attention to the tendency of
the measure. Upon the face of the proceedings themselves,
such a version of the transaction is so incredible
as to excite surprise at its adoption by contemporary historians.
A very little reflection must have discovered the
impossibility of His Majesty remaining in ignorance of
the spirit, aim, and purport of a scheme which had been
under discussion for three weeks in the Commons, and
had been sifted, explored, and denounced by Pitt, Jenkinson,
the Lord Advocate, Mr. Grenville, and others. Nor is it
to be believed that, with so strong a motive operating in
the minds of His Majesty's personal friends as that which
was furnished by the well-known desire of His Majesty
to seize upon the first opportunity to make a breach with
the Cabinet, Lord Temple and those who acted with him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
would have suffered His Majesty to continue in the
ignorance ascribed to him&mdash;assuming, which it is unreasonable
to assume, that His Majesty really was ignorant
of the scope and design of a ministerial proposal which
had called up remonstrances and protests from all parts
of the kingdom.</p>

<p>It is scarcely necessary to say that Lord Temple did
not wait until the Bills had reached the House of Lords,
to submit to the King his opinion of them; and that he
had all throughout earnestly impressed upon His Majesty
the objectionable spirit of those clauses that infringed
the royal prerogative. This was, indeed, the only vulnerable
point upon which His Majesty's direct interference
could be properly invoked. The difficulty that had hitherto
stood in the way was as to the manner in which the interposition
of the King's authority could be brought to bear
constitutionally on the measure, during its progress through
Parliament. Ministers had an ascertained and decisive
majority in the Commons, and Lord Temple seems to
have felt that it would have been unwise in His Majesty
to have interfered at that stage of the proceedings, when
his interference was likely to have failed of the desired
effect. The last resource was in the Peers. To have implicated
the King's name in the opposition to the
measure, while it yet was in the hands of the Commons,
would have fatally compromised His Majesty's position;
and for that excellent reason, Lord Temple reserved the
declaration of His Majesty's opinion for that arena where
it was most likely to exercise a practical influence.
The moment chosen was just before the debate on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
principle of the Bills. Had His Majesty been advised to
preserve his neutrality pending the discussion in the Lords,
the probability was, that the measure would have passed that
House, and that he would have been ultimately reduced
to the necessity of refusing his assent to it; an extremity
from which he was delivered by the prompt and novel
course recommended by Lord Temple.</p>

<p>Amongst the Grenville papers there is the rough draught
of a memorandum, which reveals to us not only the
suggestions upon which the King acted in this emergency,
but the no less important fact that the line of action was
submitted to His Majesty eight days before the Bills
had passed the Commons. It is evident from the tone
of this memorandum, that the subject matter of it had
previously occupied much anxious consideration, that the
determination to resist the Bills in some shape was
already adopted, and that nothing remained to be settled
but the <i>modus operandi</i>. It will be seen, that in this
memorandum the difficulties attending the royal interference
at different stages of the measure are fully designated,
and that the mode of proceeding finally adopted by
His Majesty is distinctly pointed out. The opening line,
and the note at the foot, are in the hand-writing of Lord
Temple; the body of the memorandum is in a different
and not very legible hand.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Dec. 1st, 1783.</p>

<p>To begin with stating to His Majesty our sentiments upon
the extent of the Bill, viz.:</p>

<p>We profess to wish to know whether this Bill appear to His
Majesty in this light: a plan to take more than half the royal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
power, and by that means disable [the King] for the rest of
the reign. There is nothing else in it which ought to call
for this interposition.</p>

<p>Whether any means can be thought of, short of changing
his Ministers, to avoid this evil.</p>

<p>The refusing the Bill, if it passes the Houses, is a violent
means. The changing his Ministers after the last vote of the
Commons, in a less degree might be liable to the same sort
of construction.</p>

<p>An easier way of changing his Government would be by
taking some opportunity of doing it, when, in the progress of
it, it shall have received more discountenance than hitherto.</p>

<p>This must be expected to happen in the Lords in a greater
degree than can be hoped for in the Commons.</p>

<p>But a sufficient degree of it may not occur in the Lords
if those whose duty to His Majesty would excite them to
appear are not acquainted with his wishes, and that in a
manner which would make it impossible to pretend a doubt
of it, in case they were so disposed.</p>

<p>By these means the discountenance might be hoped to raise
difficulties so high as to throw it [out], and leave His Majesty
at perfect liberty to choose whether he will change them or not.</p>

<p>This is the situation which it is wished His Majesty should
find himself in.</p>

<p>Delivered by Lord Thurlow, Dec. 1st, 1783.<br/>
<span class="smcap">Nugent Temple.</span></p></div>

<p>The sequel is matter of history. On the 17th of
December, the India Bills were rejected, in the House
of Peers, by a majority of 95 to 76. On the 18th,
at midnight, a message was transmitted from the King
to Lord North and Mr. Fox, commanding them to deliver<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
up their seals of office; and, in order to mark emphatically
the royal displeasure, they were desired to send in
their seals by the Under-Secretaries, as a personal interview
with them would be "disagreeable" to His Majesty.
The next day the rest of the Ministry were dismissed, and
the letters conveying their dismissal were signed by Lord
Temple.</p>

<p>The circumstances under which this sudden change in
the councils of the Sovereign took place, produced considerable
alarm in the Commons, by whose support alone&mdash;in
opposition to the feelings of the King, and the voice
of the public&mdash;the late Ministry had been sustained in
office. An apprehension prevailed amongst the members
that the new Cabinet would advise a dissolution, and an
Address to the King was accordingly passed on the 22nd,
praying His Majesty not to adopt that measure; but
Mr. Pitt, to whom the responsibility of constructing an
Administration had been confided in the meanwhile, entertained
no such project, having resolved to trust in the first
instance to his strength out of doors; and His Majesty's
answer to the address explicitly assured the Commons,
accordingly, that he had no intention of exercising his
prerogative either to prorogue or dissolve Parliament.</p>

<p>For three days Lord Temple held the Seals, to facilitate
Mr. Pitt's negotiations; and shortly afterwards the new
Government was announced, with Mr. Pitt at its head,
Lord Howe at the Admiralty, Lord Thurlow as Lord
Chancellor, and the Marquis of Carmarthen and Lord
Sydney in the Foreign and Home Departments. The
Duke of Rutland, who for a short time held the office of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
Lord Privy Seal (in which he was succeeded by Lord
Gower), was sent to Ireland to succeed Lord Northington
early in the ensuing year.</p>

<p>Up to this time, notwithstanding the signal services he
had rendered to the Sovereign throughout a period marked
by the most extraordinary contest in our annals between
the Crown and a dominant party in the Commons, Lord
Temple had waited in vain for that acknowledgment of
his conduct in Ireland to which he felt himself entitled.
The position of the King during the conflict that had
been forced upon him with his Ministers was, doubtless,
no less embarrassing than painful; but now that Mr. Pitt
had succeeded to office, Lord Temple expected full justice
would be done to him. That he did not receive it, however,
and that his proud and sensitive temper resented
the neglect, will be evident from the following letter, which
closes the correspondence for the year.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>LORD TEMPLE TO MR. PITT.</p>

<p>Stowe, Dec. 29th, Half-past One.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,</p>

<p>I am sorry that you should have had the trouble of acknowledging
at so late a period a letter which was indeed very
interesting to me, but to which I have not even expected any
answer for the last eight weeks; and I perfectly agree with
you, "that it would be of little use to enter in[to] particulars"
respecting the considerations so immediately affecting my
credit, a[nd?] honour, which we certainly view so differently.
If any communication had been wished for from me upon these
points, upon which it was known by Mr. Grenville and by
you that I was not indifferent, I should have thought it my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
duty of friendship to have stated my reasons for being confident
that the new Irish arrangements cannot be useful, upon the
same principles as have been thought (by you) sufficient to
bury former distinctions of party in this country: I have
already stated to you my reasons for considering the recal of
Mr. Ponsonby and of his friends to power and confidence in
Ireland as a most dangerous measure, and as a departure from
a system to which His Majesty's Government was pledged,
not only with your approbation, but with your strong and
decided opinion. I have likewise stated the reasons why I
consider such a measure, unaccompanied with any mark to me
of the King's approbation of my conduct, as the strongest
disavowal of my Government in Ireland, and (not to use harsh
expressions) as the most personal offence to me. In that point
of view I know that it has been almost universally considered
in Ireland; because the natural intemperance of those to whom
I feel myself sacrificed has not been controlled by any proof
of the interest which it had been supposed you would have
felt naturally in whatever so nearly concerned me. And with
these impressions, I felt strongly the kindness of my brother,
Mr. Grenville, who endeavoured to calm those feelings, and
to suggest various marks of favour (if you should approve
them) which did not appear to him precluded by any difficulties
of which he was aware.</p>

<p>And by that kindness I was induced to acquiesce in his
wish to be permitted to open to you an idea which I find that
Mr. Grenville and you consider (in part of it) as strongly
objectionable, as hazardous to Government, and as unwise on
my part. As I cannot think of accepting the peerage for my
second son under such circumstances, I have only to express
my regrets that the idea ever has been opened to you. I was
never very particularly attached to it, and certainly feel the
full force of your arguments against it; but I likewise feel as
fully that the arrangements which you have taken, with your<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
eyes open to the consequences (as far as I am concerned in the
question), leave me without alternative. I need not add that
the consequences of this must be most painful to me from
reflections embittered by the warm affection I bore to those who
view all this so differently from me.</p>

<p>I have, from attention to you, sent back your messenger
immediately. I have, therefore, hardly had time to consider
the expressions of this letter. I shall, therefore, thank you if
(notwithstanding your press of business) you will, from
recollection of former habits, be kind enough to give me one
line, to tell me whether I have made myself understood or not;
and you will likewise think it necessary to give me some answer
respecting your <i>engagement</i> to Mr. Gamon, in August last, to
include him in the <i>first list</i> of Baronets. If you wish for a
copy of your letter on that subject, you shall have it, but
an immediate explanation to him from you, as well as me, is
absolutely necessary.</p>

<p>I am, with very sincere regrets, and with the deepest
sensations of pain for what has passed, and for what is yet
to come,</p>

<p>Dear Sir,<br/>
Your very obedient and humble servant,<br/>
N. T.</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span></p>


<h2><a name="year-1784" id="year-1784">1784.</a></h2>

<h3>Mr. Pitt's Administration&mdash;Lord Temple Created Marquis of
Buckingham&mdash;His Private Notes on the Coalition.</h3>


<p>The relative position of parties at the opening of 1784
was singular and unprecedented. The exultation of the
public on the dismissal of the late Ministers, and the
accession of Mr. Pitt to power, afforded the undeniable
proof that the people were with the Sovereign and his
advisers. Addresses of thanks and congratulation poured
in from the municipal and corporate bodies in all parts of
the kingdom, who felt their privileges endangered by the
East India Bills, expressing the gratitude of the country
to His Majesty for the vigour and resolution with which
he had acted. The Coalition, nevertheless, still wielded
a powerful majority in the Commons, with which they
continued to harass the Cabinet, in spite of those demonstrations
of public opinion which plainly warned them
that, long as they might succeed in protracting the
struggle, it could end only in disaster and defeat. The King
and the Cabinet were, in short, brought into open hostility
with the Commons by the persevering resistance of that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
unnatural and unprincipled combination which, stung by
recent failure and disgrace, now manifested greater virulence
than ever. Two days after the reassembling of Parliament,
in January, Mr. Pitt introduced his India Bill. It was
immediately rejected by the Commons. This was his
first defeat. Every subsequent movement of the Government
was frustrated in the same way. All the resources
of parliamentary tactics were resorted to for the purpose
of dislodging the Minister. Resolutions were passed
declaring that the late changes were not calculated to conciliate
the House, and that the continuance in office of
the new Ministers was injurious to the interests of both
King and people; and, finding that these resolutions failed
of the desired effect, more violent measures were adopted.
The Mutiny Bill was postponed, and the appropriation of
the supplies was suspended.</p>

<p>In this desperate state of affairs, it appeared to be
absolutely impossible to carry on the business of the
country; and, driven to the last extremity, negotiations
were opened with the Duke of Portland, in the hope of
appeasing the Opposition, and strengthening the hands
of Government. But the Duke of Portland made demands
which were incompatible with the dignity of the
Minister, and which only tended to increase the difficulty
of the situation. It is believed that he went so far as
to stipulate for Mr. Pitt's resignation. Mr. Pitt, however,
refused to resign, and the negotiation was broken off.
Throughout the whole of this contest, Mr. Pitt maintained
an attitude of firmness, and displayed an amount
of ability which greatly increased his popularity. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
Opposition, powerful as it was, finally gave way under
his undaunted spirit, their numbers daily diminishing as
the inutility of perseverance became more and more evident,
until at length he reduced the majority against him
to one on a vote of confidence. At this point the Coalition
vanished. It was not, however, till the month of March
that he succeeded in crushing his formidable opponents;
and having thus demonstrated the real strength of his
Government by the most constitutional means, he dissolved
the Parliament&mdash;an alternative which a less confident and
conscientious Minister might have justifiably availed himself
of long before. The appeal to the people was enthusiastically
responded to; and when the next Parliament
met, an amendment on the Address, moved by Lord
Surrey, was rejected by a majority of 76. Mr. Pitt's
Government was now established on the firmest basis.</p>

<p>Throughout these proceedings, Lord Temple maintained
a strict reserve. Except when his opinions were solicited
on the subject of Ireland, he does not appear to have
tendered his advice, or in any form to have identified
himself with the Government. His regard for Mr. Pitt
isolated him from a prominent participation in public
affairs at this crisis; for as he would not act against the
Administration, and was precluded from the opportunity
of serving it as he desired to do, no choice was left to
him but that of a friendly neutrality. He still continued,
notwithstanding, to feel a deep interest in Irish affairs;
but it was limited almost exclusively to his private letters,
and even in this shape he abstained from all direct interference.
Lord Northington, who is said to have been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
invited by Mr. Pitt to retain the Lord-Lieutenancy, remained
in office till February, when he was displaced
by the Duke of Rutland. In the interval, Lord Temple's
silence on all matters relating to the government of that
country, has left scarcely any traces of his feelings or
opinions in the scanty correspondence of this period.</p>

<p>On the 8th of January, writing to General Cuninghame,
whom he had formerly recommended to the command
in Ireland for his "superior fitness," and who
had recently applied for it on the resignation of General
Burgoyne, he intimates his position very clearly:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Variety of circumstances have placed me in a situation
wholly divested of power or of official information; so that
in the present moment I do not even know whether General
Burgoyne is still in command or not; still less do I know the
ideas of Government upon it.</p></div>

<p>General Cuninghame, in reply, expresses the regret
which he felt, in common with others, that his Lordship,
who had occupied so conspicuous a place in the favour of
the King during the late ministerial crisis, had relinquished
the power which His Majesty had invested him
with.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>For a thousand reasons, public and private, I am sorry you
found yourself under the necessity of resigning the Seals, and
for the same thousand reasons I hope your Lordship will soon
again accept of office.</p></div>

<p>The resignation of the Seals, here alluded to, was a step
Lord Temple felt himself called upon to take by a nice and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
punctilious sense of honour; but which, upon a broader
view of the exigencies of the public service, and the peculiar
demands of the occasion, could not have been considered
imperative. It had reference to the resolution of
the Commons, impugning as a high crime and misdemeanour
the circulation of the opinions of the King,
with a view to influence the decision of Parliament. That
resolution was avowedly pointed at Lord Temple; and in
order that he might be enabled, without embarrassing the
Sovereign or the Government, to meet any subsequent
action which the Commons might think fit to found upon
it, Lord Temple resigned. His chivalry, however, was a
mere waste of that generous self-abnegation which characterized
his whole public life. The Commons never proceeded
any farther in the matter.</p>

<p>In another letter to General Cuninghame, dated 1st of
March, Lord Temple expresses his regret that his recommendation
of that officer to His Majesty had not the effect
he desired, and again assures him that he possesses no
power or influence with the Administration.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I am favoured with your letter upon General Pitt's appointment.
I need not repeat that if I had continued in Ireland, I
should have shown every attention to your wishes. In my
present situation I neither have been nor can be consulted
in official arrangements. My warm affection and near relationship
towards the Duke of Rutland and Mr. Pitt have disposed
me to give them the best advice which my experience in
Ireland could suggest to me; and in the course of these communications,
your pretensions to the command were stated with
every advantage.</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span></p>

<p>General Cuninghame replies by declaring that he considers
himself very ill-used, after having supported the
British Government in Ireland for thirty-three years in
Parliament; but adds: "Why should I complain to my
benefactor, who has it not in his power to relieve me?"</p>

<p>Amongst the Irish correspondents who continued to
look up to Lord Temple as the statesman who best understood
the circumstances and wants of the country, was
Colonel Martin, the owner of the vast estates of Connemara,
who afterwards acquired a special reputation in
the Imperial Parliament, by his Bill for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Animals. At the period when he was in correspondence
with Lord Temple, the humanity for which he
was subsequently distinguished did not, it is said, extend
to his own species; for no man, in a land notorious for
feudal violence, enjoyed a wider celebrity as a duellist.
From a letter written in the July of this year, the following
extract may be inserted, as being strikingly characteristic
both of the writer and the state of society over which, in
those belligerent days, men of such grave temperaments
as the Grenvilles were called upon to preside.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>You have perhaps heard already of my affair at Castlebar
with Mr. Fitzgerald. On the 14th I went to Castlebar, where
with some difficulty and after the use of language not very
consonant to my feelings, I prevailed on Mr. Fitzgerald to
meet me in the barrack-yard. When I took my first ground,
I was distant about eight yards from him, but on his declaring
in a vaunting manner that we were not near enough, I told
him he should not have reason to complain on that head, and
accordingly I advanced within less than five yards to him, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
said he had it in his power to make it much nearer. We both
fired about the same time; he missed me, but my shot entered
his waistcoat and passed along his breast and grazed his arm.
He then called to me not to fire again until he recovered his
pistol, on which I declared I would wait any time he chose.
When he was ready, we fired as before; my shot hit him
just above the waistband of his breeches and got out on the
opposite side of his waistcoat. I was wounded in the breast,
but very slightly; and I am at present so well as to be able to
travel anywhere in my carriage.</p>

<p>Mr. Fitzgerald shows his clothes to every person, but declares
he is not wounded; for my part, I will not declare my reasons
for believing him to be unhurt. On the ground he declared
himself sorry for the offence, and that he was <i>wounded</i>. For
the last I declared my sorrow, so everything ended.</p></div>

<p>Although Lord Temple throughout this year, as he
observes in one of his letters, "lived too little in the
political world" to evince much interest in its vicissitudes,
the honours which his official career had so well earned
followed him into private life. Towards the close of
1784, he was created Marquis of Buckingham.</p>

<p>In his retirement, however, he was not an inattentive
observer of public affairs, and seems to have contemplated
the design of drawing up an account of that memorable
struggle of parties of which he had been a witness, and
especially of the transactions in which he had been directly
and personally concerned. That he did not carry this
design into execution, and that nothing remains of it but
the following fragment, is much to be regretted, as few
men were so well qualified by experience, knowledge and
ability, to become the historian of these events. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
fragment, for it is nothing more, breaking off at the most
interesting point of the narrative, which it was evidently
the writer's intention to pursue to the close, is printed
with the title, and exactly in the form in which it was
left by Lord Temple. It is hardly necessary to remark
that there is an error in the date, which has reference to
the months of November and December, 1783, and not
1784, a mistake which probably arose from the circumstance
of these notes having been put together in the
latter year.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>LORD BUCKINGHAM'S PRIVATE NOTES.</p>

<p>I have much lamented that, during the very interesting
period of November and December, of 1784, I did not keep a
regular journal of the transactions of those months, in which
I am supposed to have borne so principal a share. Many of
the minuter springs which guided those operations have slipped
my memory, from the multiplicity of them, and from the
rapidity with which they crowded upon each other during the
latter busy days, ending with the formation of the new Ministry
on the 21st of December, 1784. It will, however, be necessary
for me to take this narrative from an earlier period,
necessarily connected with it&mdash;I mean the formation of the
Government known by the name of the Coalition Ministry.</p>

<p>I was in Ireland during that period, and was not uninformed,
authentically, of the disposition on the part of Lord North to
have supported the Ministry of Lord Shelburne upon terms of
provision for his friends, very short of those which he afterwards
claimed and extorted from Mr. Fox. It was clearly
known to Lord Shelburne, that no official arrangement was
proposed by Lord North for himself; and, to say truth, those
of his friends for whom he wished provision to be made, were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
at least as unexceptionable as many, I may even add as most
of those whom Lord Shelburne had collected from the two
former Administrations. The infatuation, however, which pervaded
the whole of his Government, operated most forcibly in
this instance. The affectation of holding the ostensible language
of Mr. Pitt, in 1759, is only mentioned to show the
ridiculous vanity of the Minister who, unsupported by public
success, or by the parliamentary knowledge and man&oelig;uvre of
a Duke of Newcastle, not only held it, but acted upon it, professing,
in his own words, to "know nothing of the management
of a House of Commons, and to throw himself upon the
people alone for support." This farce operated as it might be
expected; and although the negotiation between Lord North
and Mr. Fox was matter of perfect notoriety for several weeks,
those moments were suffered to pass away without any attempt
to avail himself of the various difficulties which presented themselves,
at the different periods of that discussion, till, at the very
eve of the ratification of it, Mr. Pitt was employed by his Lordship
to open propositions, through Mr. Fox, to that party.
This was rejected <i>in toto</i>; and the events which followed the
meeting of Parliament, are too well known to make a detail of
them necessary.</p>

<p>Before I proceed I wish to add, that although I have treated
the vanity and personal arrogance of Lord Shelburne as it
deserves, yet I will do him justice in acknowledging his merit,
as one of the quickest and most indefatigable Ministers that
this country ever saw. Many of his public measures were the
result of a great and an informed mind, assisted by a firm and
manly vigour. And I must ever think the Peace, attended
with all its collateral considerations, the most meritorious and
happiest event for a kingdom exhausted of men and of credit.
I was not pledged in the slightest degree to the measure; for,
by my absence in Ireland, and my little connection with his
Lordship, I was enabled to judge of it with coolness and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
impartiality; and from the knowledge of the various difficulties
attending it, I am convinced that better terms could not be
obtained, and that the further prosecution of the war was
impracticable, even if the combination against us allowed the
hope of success. This testimony I have wished to bear, though
it is not immediately connected with my purpose.</p>

<p>Upon the resignation of Lord Shelburne, His Majesty was
placed in a situation in which, through the various events of
his reign, he never had yet found himself. The man&oelig;uvres
which he tried, at different periods of the six weeks during
which this country was left literally without a Government, are
well known. Perhaps nothing can paint the situation of his
mind so truly, as a letter which he wrote to me on the 1st of
April: this was an answer to one which I thought it necessary
to address to him from Ireland, after receiving from
him a message and a general detail of his situation, through
Mr. W. Grenville, to whom he opened himself very confidentially
upon the general state of the kingdom.</p>

<p>Upon my return to England, I was honoured with every
public attention from His Majesty, who ostensibly held a
language upon my subject, calculated to raise in the strongest
degree the jealousy of his servants. In the audience which I
asked, as a matter of course, after being presented at his lev&eacute;e,
he recapitulated all the transactions of that period, with the
strongest encomium upon Mr. Pitt, and with much apparent
acrimony hinted at Lord Shelburne, whom he stated to have
abandoned a situation which was tenable, and particularly so
after the popular resentment had been roused. This was
naturally attended with strong expressions of resentment
and disgust of his Ministers, and of personal abhorrence of
Lord North, whom he charged with treachery and ingratitude
of the blackest nature. He repeated that, to such a Ministry
he never would give his confidence, and that he would take the
first moment for dismissing them. He then stated the proposition<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
made to him by the Duke of Portland, for the annual
allowance of &pound;100,000 to His Royal Highness the Prince of
Wales. I gave to him, very much at length, my opinion of such
a measure, and of the certain consequences of it: in all which,
as may reasonably be supposed, His Majesty ran before me,
and stated with strong disgust the manner in which it was
opened to him&mdash;as a thing <i>decided</i>, and even drawn up in the
shape of a message, to which his signature was desired as a
matter of course, to be brought before Parliament the next
day. His Majesty declared himself to be decided to resist this
attempt, and to push the consequences to their full extent, and
to try the spirit of the Parliament and of the people upon it.
I thought it my duty to offer to him my humble advice to go
on with his Ministers, if possible, in order to throw upon them
the ratification of the Peace, which they professed to intend to
ameliorate, and to give them scope for those mountains of
reform, which would inevitably come very short of the expectations
of the public. From these public measures, and from
their probable dissension, I thought that His Majesty might
look forward to a change of his Ministers in the autumn; and
that, as the last resource, a dissolution of this Parliament,
chosen by Lord North and occasionally filled by Mr. Fox,
might offer him the means of getting rid of the chains which
pressed upon him. To all this he assented; but declared his
intention to resist, at all events and hazards, the proposition
for this enormous allowance to His Royal Highness, of whose
conduct he spoke with much dissatisfaction. He asked, what
he might look to if upon this refusal the Ministry should
resign: and I observed, that, not having had the opportunity
of consulting my friends, I could only answer that their resignation
was a proposition widely differing from their dismissal,
and that I did not see the impossibility of accepting his
Administration in such a contingency, provided the supplies
and public bills were passed, so as to enable us to prorogue the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
Parliament. To all this he assented, and declared his intention
of endeavouring to gain time, that the business of
Parliament might go on; and agreed with me that such a
resignation was improbable, and that it would be advisable
not to dismiss them, unless some very particular opportunity
presented itself.</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="year-1785" id="year-1785"></a>1785.</h2>

<h3>The Breach Between the Marquis of Buckingham and Mr. Thomas
Grenville.</h3>


<p>Mr. Pitt's Government was now reaping all the advantages
of peace and security. The lull that followed the
termination of the American War and the dispersion of
the Coalition, enabled the Minister to consolidate his power
and develop his plans. Lord North, who had the misfortune
not long afterwards to lose his eyesight, was
receding from the arena on which he had acted so remarkable
a part during the preceding fourteen years;
and Mr. Fox and his adherents, returning again to their
own natural orbit, were vindicating their integrity and
consistency in the maintenance of a constitutional Opposition.
Faction, weakened and dismembered, had fallen
before the genius of Mr. Pitt.</p>

<p>The principal measure in the Cabinet in 1785 was
a Bill for the reform of the representation in Parliament,
by which Mr. Pitt proposed to transfer the franchises of
thirty-six boroughs to counties and unrepresented towns.
A clause in this Bill, for giving pecuniary compensation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
to the disfranchised boroughs, was fatal to its reception.
Mr. Fox laid down the maxim, that the franchise was
not a property, but a trust: the House adopted that view
of the question, and the Bill was lost. But Mr. Pitt,
nevertheless, discharged his pledge to the public by thus
initiating the principle of parliamentary reform.</p>

<p>The Marquis of Buckingham still continued a passive
spectator of public events, and the correspondence of this
period possesses consequently little political interest. We
learn by a letter from his brother, Mr. W. W. Grenville,
that he had placed his proxy in the hands of Lord
Camelford, who was so embarrassed by the responsibility,
that he took counsel with Lord Sydney and Mr. Grenville
as to the course he should follow in reference to a particular
vote. Mr. Grenville, exercising his usual good
sense and practical judgment, strongly recommended his
Lordship to withdraw his proxy altogether, rather than
to have it exposed to the chance of compromising his
opinions.</p>

<p>The unhappy difference between the Marquis of
Buckingham and his brother, Mr. Thomas Grenville,
was not yet adjusted; and time seems only to have
widened a breach which both deplored, and were equally
anxious to remove. The proud feelings of the Marquis,
wounded by the injustice with which he conceived he
had been treated, were peculiarly sensitive to every act
on the part of his friends that departed in the slightest
degree from the line he had marked out for himself.
Perhaps he expected from them more in this respect than
the obligations of public life could be reasonably expected<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
to concede; in this instance, at least, he appears to have
exaggerated into a personal wrong a vote which was given
on pure and independent grounds, without a suspicion
that it was open to so injurious an interpretation. Mr.
Thomas Grenville's letter on this painful subject is an
honourable testimony alike to his integrity and his affection.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Brother</span>,</p>

<p>Anything that comes from you with the least prospect of
bringing back to me those sentiments of affection which, in
spite of any political differences, it has always been my first
wish to keep alive between us; any intimation of your looking
for a brother in one who has never ceased to be so to you;
I cannot but be eager to express the pleasure and satisfaction I
feel in receiving from you. And if I did not feel shocked and
wounded by those expressions which ascribe to my vote motives
so foreign to my nature, that I can scarce bear to read or
repeat them, my hopes of living with you in the affectionate
intercourse of a brother would have kept my attention to that
pleasing prospect only, and would have shut my lips upon
every past subject of difference. Can I really have to think
that you are serious in considering me as having struck at your
honour and your life by any vote that I have given? That such
an expression can have come from you after a year's reflection,
wounds me more than anything that could be said in the first
moments of anger; and it is not against such a charge that I
can argue to defend myself.</p>

<p>I cannot say with how much concern it is, that I have felt
myself obliged to allude to anything that has passed, nor could<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
I have been forced now to do it, was it not that to have said
nothing upon a charge so cruel might have looked like
acquiescing in the justice of it: of that vote I have always said,
and God knows, always truly said, that I made in it no personal
attack, felt in it nothing hostile to you, and regretted in it
only the misrepresentation and misconception of others. I
have said more, and still say, that the misunderstanding of
that vote is so grievous to me, that, blameless as my motives
were, I would not have given it, if I had thought it liable to
the misrepresentations that have been made of it; yet, God
knows, I thought it could be mistaken only by those who did
not know me.</p>

<p>I return with pleasure, my dear brother, to that part of your
note, in which I hope I find again the prospect of that near
affectionate relation, the renewal of which on your part, my
mind has ever been anxious for, and ever eager to bring about,
from the first moment that political differences had separated us;
for, upon political subjects, my mind receives no impression that
can stop in it the feelings of relationship, kindness, and
affection, all of which I will hope, my dearest brother, the
latter words of your note again open the way to&mdash;a way in which
I cannot too often repeat, how gladly and happily I should go
forward in.</p>

<p>Ever your very affectionate brother,<br/>
<span class="smcap">Thomas Grenville</span>.</p></div>

<p>The following passage, in the Marquis of Buckingham's
hand-writing, apparently cut out of a former letter to
which the above is the reply, seems to contain the observations
from which Mr. Thomas Grenville extracted the
hope of reconciliation. It is enclosed in his letter as if
it had been returned to the writer.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>When you joined in the vote which impeached my honour,
and possibly my life, you forgot the feelings of a brother, and
dissolved the ties between us. I loathe the looking back, still
less do I mean to reproach: my heart is still alive to those
feelings which nature and religion dictate to me.</p>

<p>I have no false pride, and, therefore, have no conditions to
propose to you. All that I look for is a <i>brother</i>; but in that
word I comprehend all the sentiments of affection which I feel
I discharged faithfully towards you till the moment of our
separation. Consult your feelings, and God direct them.</p></div>

<p>In the next letter, Mr. W. W. Grenville communicates
a scrap of political gossip to his brother.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>MR. W. W. GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.</p>

<p>Oakley, Sunday, August 9th, 1785.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Brother</span>,</p>

<p>Having just heard a most curious piece of news, I take the
first moment of acquainting you with it, though, perhaps, you
will have been informed of it through some other channel.
It is no less than a sudden resolution taken by Wyndham of
resigning his office, in consequence of an inflammatory fever
with which he was seized at Oxford, on his way back to Dublin.
Lord Northington's friends in London have undertaken very
kindly to supply his loss, and have offered his secretaryship to
Tom Pelham, who has accepted, and waits only for the form of
being appointed by Lord Northington to the situation of his
confidential Minister and friend.</p>

<p>Their Irish peers are Clements, Matthew, Jonson, Pomeroy,
and Mr. Hutchinson; together with Deland, Pennant, and
Pennington.</p>

<p>The wags say that this is the second voyage to the North<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
Pole, in which Wyndham has stopped short. I own I think
he has used his principal very ill, and himself not very well.
The other's accepting is not much less extraordinary.</p>

<p>I should not be quite surprised if Lord Northington should
follow his quondam Secretary's example. At any rate, conceive
the confusion in which the country must now be, with the harvest,
the election, and nothing like a Government; the Secretary not
appointed, and the Lord-Lieutenant doing business <i>on Thursdays,
from twelve till two</i>.</p>

<p>You see Hussy Burgh is not in the list. Should not you
write him an ostensible letter on the subject?</p>

<p>I shall go to town in a day or two at furthest, and will write
to you from thence.</p>

<p>Adieu, my dear brother,<br/>
Ever most affectionately yours,<br/>
W. W. G.</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="year-1786" id="year-1786"></a>1786.</h2>

<h3>Mr. W. W. Grenville Joins Mr. Pitt's Administration.</h3>


<p>While the Marquis of Buckingham abstained from
active participation in public business, he maintained the
most friendly relations with Mr. Pitt, warmly supporting
the Minister in all matters upon which his individual
adhesion, advice, and local influence could add strength
and character to his Administration. That he persevered,
however, in cultivating the retirement he had chosen, in
preference to throwing himself personally into the ocean
of action, may be inferred from the following letter,
which announces the accession of Mr. Grenville to the
Government as Vice-President of the Committee of
Trade.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>MR. W. W. GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.</p>

<p>Whitehall, August 10th, 1786.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Brother</span>,</p>

<p>I said nothing to you in my last about going to Court,
because, as everybody in town had gone on Friday, I did not
think it material for you to come up, considering your distance;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
and I was unwilling to advise your putting yourself to any inconvenience
of that sort, which did not appear to be absolutely
necessary.</p>

<p>But yesterday's lev&eacute;e was fuller than Friday's, and crowded
with all sorts of people, particularly the Opposition, who came
from all quarters of the kingdom. This being the case, I
cannot help thinking that you would do right to come up for
the next lev&eacute;e, which is Friday next; the King keeping the
Duke of York's birthday on Wednesday, at Windsor. I mentioned
the subject to-day to Pitt, who seemed to think it very
desirable that you should do this, as a mark of attention, in
return for the many civilities which we have lately received from
that quarter. As several places have addressed on the occasion, I
think if you would bring up an address from the loyal corporation
of Buckingham, it would be a sort of apology for your
absence hitherto.</p>

<p>The Committee of Trade is to be declared that day in council.
Lord Hawkesbury is to kiss hands as President, and your
humble servant as Vice-President. Lord Hawkesbury also
kisses hands for the Duchy, and Lord Clarendon for the Post-Office,
in the room of Lord Tankerville, who goes out upon a
sort of quarrel between him and Lord Cartaret. Mornington
kisses hands to-morrow for the Treasury.</p>

<p>I believe these are all the arrangements that will now be
made. The seat on the Bench is not yet disposed of, and from
what I judged by the Chancellor's looks the other day, when I
saw him at council, I very much fear that a more extensive law
arrangement will soon be necessary. Lord Mansfield is also
said to be worse again.</p>

<p>Adieu, my dear brother,<br/>
Believe me ever most sincerely and affectionately yours,<br/>
W. W. G.</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span></p>

<p>That the weight of Lord Buckingham's opinions was
strongly felt in the nomination of Mr. Grenville and
others to office, is abundantly testified by a letter of the
same date, in which Lord Mornington ascribes to the
favourable recommendations of the Marquis his seat at
the Treasury.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>LORD MORNINGTON TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.</p>

<p>August 10th, 1786.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Lord</span>,</p>

<p>I trouble you with this letter to inform you that Pitt has
offered me the vacant seat at the Board of Treasury, and that
I have accepted it: nothing could be more flattering or kind
than the manner in which this offer was made; I will trouble
you with the circumstances which attended it when I have the
pleasure of seeing you. William Grenville's friendship has been
exerted with its usual warmth and sincerity on this occasion;
and I feel so strongly the effect of your former activity in my
favour, that although your absence from town has prevented my
applying to you on this occasion, yet I must attribute this, as I
shall any future success, to the ground which you laid for me,
and to the uniform assiduity with which you have supported my
pretensions: therefore, although you have had no immediate
concern (that I know) in this specific object, I must beg of
you to accept a very large share of the gratitude which I feel to
those who have promoted it for me. The Vice-Treasurerships,
as I suppose you know, do not go to Ireland.</p>

<p>I hope to have the pleasure of paying my duty to you at
Stowe, in the autumn; perhaps I may have the good fortune
to see you sooner in town, as I hear that you are coming up<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
with a loyal address. I beg my best compliments to Lady
Buckingham.</p>

<p>Believe me, my dear Lord,<br/>
Ever most sincerely your obliged and affectionate<br/>
<span class="smcap">Mornington</span>.</p></div>

<p>The "object," dimly and cautiously alluded to in the
annexed letters, was that of a peerage, to which the high
pretensions of Mr. W. W. Grenville justified him in
looking forward; but which his prudence, holding his
honourable ambition in check, made him desirous of
postponing until he had won even greater distinction as
a statesman than he had already attained.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>MR. W. W. GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.</p>

<p>Thursday, Dec. 12th, 1786.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Brother</span>,</p>

<p>You do not say a word in your letter of Apsley and his
deer.</p>

<p>Sir William Bowyers' man has declined the clerkship for
himself, and has no son old enough for it. I have a very handsome
letter from Mulgrave, leaving the Wardrobe Keeper to my
disposal. On inquiry, it appears to be worth at least &pound;100 per
annum, besides apartments in Chelsea, and coals and candles.
But residence is absolutely necessary.</p>

<p>You will therefore judge what to do with it; but the Clerk's
place must be filled up without further delay. I have allowed the
widow of the Wardrobe Keeper to remain in the office till March;
but if you decide on the man, I can, in order to prevent accidents,
appoint him now to take possession in March. I mention
this the rather as I fear that, to my great sorrow, I am going
to have a new colleague, which I will explain to you in ten days,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
by which time I hope to be at Stowe. It gives me very real
concern, because it is impossible for any man to have behaved
in a more gentleman-like and friendly manner than Mulgrave
has done on every occasion; and I fear his successor will have
<i>a clan</i> upon him, but that is not settled.</p>

<p>You know my <i>principal</i> object: should I press to have it
opened for me now? If I did, I believe it would be done; but
I am so much pleased with my present situation, that I am
unwilling to quit it so soon, especially as every year removes
difficulties in the way of the other. Yet, perhaps, it is not
prudent to let opportunities pass by one. On the other hand,
I shall, I am confident, be able in the next session, by the help
of my present situation, to put myself much more forward in
the House than I have hitherto done, which appears to me a
great object to attain, previous to accepting of what after all, I
fear, will wear the appearance of putting myself <i>hors de
combat</i>.</p>

<p>I am not in the same mind about it for any ten minutes
together. Pray write something to me by the return of the
post.</p>

<p>I am much grieved to hear so unpleasant an account of Lady
Buckingham, but earnestly hope that what she goes through will
be confined to suffering only, and that you will not be disappointed
in an object so interesting to you both.</p>

<p>Nothing is yet known of law enactments, nor is it by any
means certain that Lord Mansfield resigns during his life, which
is, however, in all probability, no very long period.</p>

<p>Fawcitt will have the red riband with another person, who
will surprise you.</p>

<p>What should you think of an arrangement to be settled now,
and to take place at the opening of the session of 1788? The
worst is, it would be known, which would be unpleasant to me
in a thousand ways. I never had a point to decide which puzzled
me so much. That very circumstance will probably make me<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
pass it, as if I take any step, I must do it within a day or two
at furthest. Pray write to me.</p>

<p>Ever most affectionately yours,<br/>
W. W. G.</p>

<p>If it is done in the manner I last mentioned, you must
understand that it will be irrevocably fixed, as a positive
engagement will be taken for my present office to be given at
that time; so that if I alter my mind in 1788, I shall be an
independent country gentleman.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>MR. W. W. GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.</p>

<p>Whitehall, Dec. 21st, 1786.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Brother</span>,</p>

<p>I have nothing decisive to say to you on the subject which
we discussed so much at Stowe, except that the particular
arrangement, which we agreed to be in so many respects objectionable,
certainly will not take place. My opinion is, that it
will end in my remaining as I am till <i>the other event</i> happens,
when it will be time enough to decide the question, which will
then occur, either of my present situation continuing, or of the
arrangement which you suggested instead of it, which I
mentioned to Pitt, and which he seemed in many respects to
like. The negotiation with respect to that <i>other event</i> has not
yet been opened, but will immediately be so. The period must
depend upon that person's wishes as well as mine; but mine,
as far as they will have weight, are for the time which you
seemed to prefer.</p>

<p>I do not know whether you will understand my hieroglyphics,
but I hope to explain them to you some time next week, as
Lord Harcourt and myself have, I think, nearly settled to take
our holidays then.</p>

<p>We determined nothing about the Wardrobe Keeper. Lord<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
Grimstone has been written to about Hepburne's arrangement,
but we have no answer yet. This need not, however, delay any
decision which you may take about the other, which I am very
anxious to settle before the clannism takes place,</p>

<p>Adieu, my dear brother,<br/>
Ever most affectionately yours,<br/>
W. W. G.</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="year-1787" id="year-1787"></a>1787.</h2>

<h3>The Dawn of Free Trade&mdash;The Assembly of Notables&mdash;Affairs of
Holland&mdash;Arthur Wellesley&mdash;The Marquis of Buckingham Assumes
the Government of Ireland for the Second Time.</h3>


<p>Looking back upon the acts of past administrations,
with a view to the influence they exercised over the policy
of their successors to the present time, perhaps the most
important measure introduced at this period by Mr. Pitt
was a commercial treaty with France, which may be
regarded as the first recognition by an English Minister
of the principles of Free Trade. Mr. Fox maintained
that France was the natural enemy of England, and that
it was useless to attempt to veil the rivalry of the two
countries under commercial regulations. Mr. Pitt, on the
other hand, urged that it was their mutual interest to
liberate their commerce; and that if France obtained a
market by this treaty of eight millions of people for her
wines and other productions, England profited still more
largely by gaining a market for her manufactures of
twenty-four millions.</p>

<p>The general principle of this treaty was to admit a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
mutual exportation and importation of commodities, at a
low <i>ad valorem</i> duty. The Opposition made great head
against it in the House of Commons, but it was finally
carried by a majority of 76. Curiously enough, the treaty
was negotiated by Mr. Eden, who had held the office of
Vice-Treasurer of Ireland under the Coalition, and who
was the first person to break away from that heterogeneous
confederacy, and ally himself with Mr. Pitt. His defection
was the more memorable from the fact, that the Coalition
is said to have originated with him; at all events, he
divides the credit of the project with Mr. Burke. Distinguished
by his zeal and activity, Mr. Eden was soon
afterwards raised to the peerage, under the title of Baron
Auckland.</p>

<p>While this reciprocity treaty was in progress, the finances
of France were reduced to such a state of derangement by
a system of corruption and profligate expenditure, as to
call for some strong and universal measure of redemption.
The famous Convention of Notables was the remedial
project suggested by that able but speculative financier,
M. de Calonne, who had succeeded M. Necker as Minister
of Finance. This assembly, by royal authority, of all the
considerable persons in the kingdom, excited some curiosity
in England. What was thought of it in the ministerial
circles may be gathered from a passage in a letter from
Mr. W. W. Grenville to Lord Buckingham, dated the 8th
of January.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>A resolution has been taken by the French Government, and
declared by the King in his council, which occasions a good
deal of speculation. It is no less than the calling an Assembl&eacute;e<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
generale, who are to consist of archbishops, bishops, nobles,
and deputies from the different parliaments, &amp;c., to the number
of one hundred and fifty-nine. They are to meet at Versailles,
I think in the course of next month. It is not yet declared
what is to be proposed to them. But I think it probable
that they will be to deliberate on two great plans which the
Government have in contemplation; one for abolishing all the
internal custom-houses, and the other for reducing all the
import duties universally to duties from 12 per cent to 1/4 per
cent, <i>ad valorem</i> according to certain classes. Besides this, it
is probable that the state of their finances is such as to require
very strong measures, both to provide for the existing debt,
and to make up any deficiencies arising from either of these
plans, and that Calonne thinks that he will be safer in obtaining
the sanction of such an Assembly as this. His friends give
out, that it is at his earnest entreaty that this measure is
adopted. You will probably agree with me in thinking it a
hazardous one.</p></div>

<p>Mr. Grenville's prediction was abundantly verified by
the event. The issue of the project is one of the familiar
incidents of French history. The Assembly of Notables
took place on the 22nd of February, when M. de Calonne
had the opportunity he desired of explaining his magnificent
plans. On the 5th of April, the Assembly was
adjourned to the 12th; and in the interval the Minister
was dismissed and exiled. France became involved in
inextricable confusion, and the Notables were finally dissolved
at the close of the ensuing year.</p>

<p>The affairs of Holland now began to engage the serious
attention of the English Government, and Mr. Grenville
was sent on a special mission to the Hague, to ascertain<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
the actual state of things, which, through a series of
complicated events, had at last assumed an aspect of
hostilities that appeared to threaten extensive consequences
to the peace of Europe.</p>

<p>Without entering into the conflict of diplomacies in
which Holland was embroiled with Prussia and Austria,
the immediate point to which these entangled transactions
were narrowed at the moment of Mr. Grenville's mediation,
was the attitude taken by the Prince of Orange for the
restitution of his office of hereditary Captain-General, which
had been vested in him by the unanimous vote of all the
members of the State, but which had been recently transferred
to the Deputies of Haerlem by a formal resolution of the
States of Holland. In consequence of that resolution, the
Prince had withdrawn from the Hague; and an application
which was made by the King of Prussia (to whose sister he
was married) to reinstate him in his rights, and a somewhat
similar remonstrance on the part of England, having produced
no effect, the Prince, removing his Court to Nimeguen,
encamped near Utrecht, apparently with hostile
intentions. He had in vain addressed himself to the
States, the resistance to his authority increasing with
each fresh attempt at negotiation; and at length, desirous,
perhaps, of averting extremities as long as he could,
he permitted his consort, the Princess, to adopt the
singular expedient of proceeding in person to the Hague,
where the States-General were assembled. This was in
the month of June. It could hardly have been anticipated
that the States would consent to receive so unusual
an ambassador, or that they would even allow her to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
proceed on her journey; and, accordingly, they took
measures to arrest her before she reached the Hague,
sending her back under escort to Nimeguen. This very
decided step simplified the matter at once. There was
no longer a pretext for hesitation or compromise; and
the King of Prussia, affecting to regard the indignity
offered to his sister as a personal insult to himself,
immediately set about organizing an army for the purpose
of invading Holland. The greatest consternation
prevailed throughout the country; and it was at this
crisis, while the Prussian force was gathering in the
Duchy of Cleves, that Mr. Grenville was sent to the
Hague. On the 3rd of August, immediately after his
arrival, he writes to his brother:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Nothing new has occurred here. All eyes are turned towards
the King of Prussia, whose conduct still appears contradictory.
I trust that by to-morrow we shall know something decisive.
In the meantime his army is certainly collecting, and the Duke
of Brunswick has accepted the command. Yet his other measures
indicate much leaning towards France. I am rather in
better spirits about my own particular task here, though by no
means satisfied with what I have undertaken, and which I now
think I must have had the vanity of a French Abb&eacute; to expect
to perform in four or five days.</p></div>

<p>A hurried note of the same date, made up just at the
departure of the packet, adds that the writer intends
to go to Nimeguen, and hopes to be in England at the
end of the week. On the 6th, he writes again from
the Hague, stating his intention to set out the next
morning for Nimeguen, where he should see the Princess,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
and expected to find the Prince and the Duke of Brunswick,
to whom it was understood the King of Prussia
had committed the charge, not only of the military, but
also of the political part of the business. A few days
afterwards, a note from Whitehall announces his return
to England, adding: "There is every reason to believe
that we shall disarm without subsequent negotiation, as
you must be satisfied at last."</p>

<p>The course of events, however, rendered subsequent
negotiations unavoidable. On the 8th of September,
Mr. Grenville writes: "Everything is going on much as
it was. The Duke of Brunswick's army is collected, and
was to act in about a day or two from this date, if satisfaction
was not previously given, which seemed not impossible."
On the 11th, he says: "If nothing has since
occurred to alter the plan&mdash;which, however, is by no
means improbable&mdash;the Prussian troops were to begin
their march on this day."</p>

<p>It soon became obvious that the expectations founded
on the likelihood of the submission of Holland were not
to be realised. In a letter of the 13th, Mr. Grenville
states that "the business is drawing fast to its crisis,
whatever that may be." The Prussian Ambassador had
given in demands requiring satisfaction, including the
punishment of the offenders, within four days; in failure
of which, the troops were to act. "I doubt," he adds,
"whether the State of Holland can give this, even if
they were so disposed, which is not clear. In the meantime,
not a man has moved in France, and the confusion
seems by every account to be increasing."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span></p>

<p>On the very day on which this letter was written, the
Duke of Brunswick, at the head of twenty thousand men,
had entered Holland.</p>

<p>How nearly these events had involved Europe in a
war, may be gleaned from the next letter, which is
marked "private."</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>MR. W. W. GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.</p>

<p>(Private.) Whitehall, Tuesday, Sept. 18th, 1787.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Brother</span>,</p>

<p>The storm is at last burst upon us. Montmorin has communicated
to Eden an application from Holland to the French
Court for assistance against the Prussian army, and the determination
of France to comply with this request. The answer
will be, that we cannot in any case be quiet spectators of the
operations of a French force in the Republic, and that we have
consequently given orders for arming our fleet. The press
warrants will be out on Thursday, and every other step of the
same sort is taking with the utmost expedition.</p>

<p>The Prussian army had got to Arnheim on Friday, and I
trust will have been able to act with effect before France can
give them any interruption. If this should be the case, I
think there is still a possibility of settling the business without
coming to blows, but the chances are infinitely against it.</p>

<p>The circumstance is certainly an unpleasant one, and the
crisis in some respects hazardous; but I trust that we meet it
with as much advantage, all things considered, as ever this
country had when she embarked in a war. We must therefore
go to it with resolution, and I wish I could say with unanimity,
for that appears to me to be the one thing most wanted. The
absence of so many people from town, makes it impossible as
yet to do more than speculate on that subject, which is open to
very great difficulties. I need not say that you may rely on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
hearing from me upon it as soon as there is anything to say,
and above all, that nothing will be wanting on my part to
forward your wishes to the utmost, as far as I know and understand
them.</p>

<p>Believe me ever most truly and affectionately yours,<br/>
W. W. G.</p></div>

<p>Mr. Eden was at that time negotiating the matter
in Paris; and although the Government may have reposed
implicit confidence in his discretion, they appear
to have felt that he did not possess a sufficiently accurate
knowledge of the complicated questions out of which
this difficult position had arisen, to enable him to act with
the requisite caution and promptitude. In order, therefore,
to assist him through the negotiations, in the hope
of bringing about an honourable and satisfactory peace,
Mr. Grenville was requested to proceed to Paris.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>MR. W. W. GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.</p>

<p>Whitehall, Sept. 19th, 1787.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Brother</span>,</p>

<p>In Eden's account of the conversation, in which M. de
Montmorin notified to him the intention of France to assist
their friends against the Duke of Brunswick's army, he mentions
that an intimation was made of a strong wish on their
part that means might yet be found for an amicable conclusion
of the business, and a desire that the negotiation for that
purpose might be pursued with more activity than ever.</p>

<p>Although it is very doubtful whether this is anything more
than a <i>persiflage</i>, yet, as in their present situation their resolution
may change every hour, it has been thought, after much
consideration, that we ought so far to avail ourselves of it, as to
try whether anything can be done in this way, but, at the same<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
time, by no means to lessen or suspend our preparations. One
of the difficulties on this subject was Eden's want of a competent
knowledge of the points in dispute, to enable him to
discuss them thoroughly, and to bring them to those short and
distinct issues to which they must be reduced, if anything is to
be done upon them in the very little time that now remains for
negotiation. Another, and perhaps not the least of the two,
was the strong bent of his mind to admit the assertions of the
French Government, however unfounded, and to soften our
communications, in order to keep back a rupture, which he has
so great a personal interest to prevent, in addition to those
motives which we all have in common for wishing the continuance
of peace.</p>

<p>With a view to these considerations, I was earnestly requested
to proceed to Paris for a fortnight or three weeks, in order to
carry on this negotiation jointly with him. I have been very
unwilling to accept this commission, because my opinion of the
possibility of its success is much less sanguine than that of
others. But I am satisfied that it is the duty of Government to
leave nothing untried, however hopeless, which can enable us to
maintain our ground without having recourse to extremities.
And there is certainly, <i>c&aelig;teris paribus</i>, a better chance of doing
this with the assistance of one who is in some degree acquainted
with the particulars which are likely to come in question, and
who will most undoubtedly state explicitly the real sentiments
which are entertained here. For these reasons, I have thought
myself not at liberty to refuse, and have given a reluctant
consent.</p>

<p>I shall probably set out either to-morrow evening or Friday
morning. It seems best for me not to go with any ostensible
character, as that would be ridiculous in the case of my coming
back <i>re infect&acirc;</i> within a few days after my appointment.
But in the other much less probable event, it would, I think,
be right for me to have powers to sign with Eden.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span></p>

<p>It is, on the whole, a very hazardous undertaking, and one
which, for a variety of reasons, I would gladly have avoided. I
think I am sure to carry with me your warmest wishes for my
success; and as I know the anxiety which you feel upon it, you
may depend on hearing from me as soon as I have anything
worth communicating, either good or bad.</p>

<p>In the meantime, believe me, with the truest affection,</p>

<p>My dear brother,<br/>
Most sincerely yours,<br/>
<span class="smcap">W. W. Grenville</span>.</p>

<p>P.S. There is no news, either from Harris or Eden, since I
wrote.</p></div>

<p>Two days afterwards, Mr. Grenville, in a few hasty
lines, informs his brother that he is that instant setting
out for France. "Accounts were at this moment received,"
he concludes, "that Utrecht and all the towns
in North Holland had surrendered to the Prussian troops;
and that the Free Corps were all called in to Amsterdam,
which they talked of defending."</p>

<p>The surrender of Utrecht, the stronghold of democratic
zeal, literally paralyzed the Dutch. Gorcum, Dordt,
Schoonhoven, and other towns surrendered immediately
afterwards, without striking a blow. The Senate of
Amsterdam made a vain show of resistance, by passing
a resolution to suspend the office of Stadtholder; but
the resolution was waste-paper. Wherever the Prussians
appeared, all opposition vanished, and the onward progress
of the Duke of Brunswick's army was literally a
procession of triumph.</p>

<p>We now follow Mr. Grenville to Paris.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>MR. W. W. GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.</p>

<p>S&egrave;ve, Sept. 25th, 1787.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Brother</span>,</p>

<p>I arrived at Paris this evening, and immediately set off for
this place, where Eden has a house. You will have heard all
the good news in Holland. The effect it has produced here
seems to be that of frightening these people into withdrawing
themselves from the business. If so, my mission will soon be
ended, and the general result will be so happy, that I shall have
nothing to fear from my particular share in it. I have but just
time to scrawl these three lines, as the courier is waiting, and his
getting to Calais early is of real importance.</p>

<p>Ever yours,<br/>
W. W. G.</p></div>

<p>The "good news" was neither more nor less than the
rapid and complete success which attended the arms of
Prussia, without striking a blow. While Mr. Grenville
was negotiating in Paris, to dissuade the French from
interfering, the Prince of Orange was making his public
entry into the Hague&mdash;an event which, to the astonishment
of Europe, after the sturdy independence shown by
the States in the first instance, took place within seven
days from the date of the invasion.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>MR. W. W. GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.</p>

<p>S&egrave;ve, Sept. 27th, 1787.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Brother</span>,</p>

<p>I had scarce time to put down three lines to you by the
last messenger; but you will have seen from them that our<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
business here bears a favourable aspect. I have this morning
received your letter of the 23rd, and can with truth assure you
that I feel in the strongest manner the kindness and affection
which give rise to the anxiety you express.</p>

<p>I have not yet seen any of the French Ministers, and am not
to do so till to-morrow. But the opportunities which I have of
knowing their sentiments, enable me to judge that it is not
probable that I shall enter into negotiation with them. Their
inclination certainly is very strongly to abandon the business,
and to withdraw themselves entirely from it. In this opinion
they will of course be desirous of doing this silently; and by a
sort of tacit acquiescence, rather than by any agreement or
treaty on the subject. The only thing that appears likely to
alter this, is the manner in which what has passed in Holland
is received in Paris. The indignation on the subject is almost
general; and the Ministers are universally condemned as having
been cajoled or bullied by us into the loss of their object. The
imputation is, in my opinion, very unjust. I do not believe
that they have been for a moment deceived as to our intentions,
nor have we taken any pains to deceive them. But I think that
they weighed the merits of the question itself, and decided upon
it like wise men. It is, however, impossible to say, in a country
where so much depends on public opinion, what effect may be
produced by this sort of clamour; and whether that may not
drive them, against their wishes, into measures of violence.</p>

<p>In this case, it is easy to see that they must act with precipitation,
and even with the appearance of passion, so that either
way, it is probable that I shall be at liberty to return in a week
or ten days' time. I shall certainly do it with much pleasure;
for though I felt I could not in honour decline the commission;
I accepted it, as you know, with little satisfaction.</p>

<p>The Parliament of Paris is returned, having made a most
disgraceful compromise, of registering an edict for continuing
the two new Vingti&egrave;mes, without any exceptions or privileges<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
of exemption. By this mode, the Court get the money they
want, but in a manner more oppressive and ruinous to the
country than that of the taxes they had proposed. I suppose
the example will, as is generally the case, be followed by the
provincial Parliaments.</p>

<p>Adieu, my dear brother.<br/>
Ever most affectionately yours,<br/>
W. W. G.</p></div>

<p>The successes of the Prince of Orange had relieved
France of a difficulty; for, notwithstanding that she secretly
regarded these successes with dissatisfaction, her finances
were in such a condition of derangement, that she was
glad enough of an excuse for avoiding the expenditure of
a war. Nevertheless, up to the 1st of October, Mr.
Grenville did not feel quite sure of the issue. "Things,"
he observes, "remain here still in a very undecided state.
They are making vigorous preparations, and holding very
high language. At the same time, I still think that they
will not be disinclined to listen to proposals for disarming."</p>

<p>Similar preparations were making in England; and in
this unsettled and rather menacing condition the negotiation
remained, when Mr. Grenville returned to England.
In the course of the month, however, the Duke of Dorset,
who was the English Ambassador at Paris, brought the
question to a conclusion in a formal shape.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>MR. W. W. GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.</p>

<p>Whitehall, Oct. 24th, 1787.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Brother</span>,</p>

<p>Despatches were received yesterday from the Duke of Dorset<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
and Eden, with a project of a declaration and counter-declaration
for disarming, which the French Ministers were ready to
sign. These will be returned to them to-day with a few
alterations, but of such a nature, that I have myself little
doubt of their being agreed to without difficulty, in which
case the whole business will be immediately concluded, and
in a manner which I think highly satisfactory and honourable
to us. You will, however, naturally suppose that we feel a
good deal of anxiety till the thing is actually done, as some
circumstances may arise every hour to vary it. Although
Amsterdam has formally submitted, there is a fund of much
ill-humour there; but I do not think that much is to be apprehended
from it, especially if proper and vigorous measures are
taken for the security and protection of the present Government
in Holland.</p>

<p>The alliance with the Republic will be begun upon immediately;
but it will not be a triple one, from considerations
which have originated not here, but there.</p>

<p>You will see in the papers, that the Bishop of Hereford is
dead. I immediately renewed the application to Pitt, on the
subject of Marylebone, and wrote to the Chancellor myself to
state the warm interest that we both take in Cleaver's advancement.
I have this moment received a note from Pitt, informing
me that the Chancellor has agreed, and in the handsomest
manner. I think it very lucky for Cleaver, that this man
died before Lord North. I have written to him to inform him
of the Chancellor's promise.</p>

<p>With respect to myself, I think I see ground to say, with
certainty, that nothing of the sort will take place before Parliament
meets.</p>

<p>Believe me, my dearest brother,<br/>
Ever most affectionately yours,<br/>
W. W. G.</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span></p>

<p>On the 27th of October, the Duke of Dorset presented
a memorial to the King of France, proposing the discontinuance
of warlike preparations at both sides, which
was at once agreed to, M. de Montmorin observing that
it never had been the intention of His Majesty to interfere
by force in the affairs of Holland.</p>

<p>The death of the Duke of Rutland in Ireland, on the
24th of October in this year, once more placed the office
of Lord-Lieutenant at the disposal of the Administration.
As soon as the intelligence was received in England, communications
on the subject were opened with the Marquis
of Buckingham, who, having no longer any grounds of
hesitation, personal or political, accepted the office, and on
the 2nd of November wrote to the Lords Justices to
announce his appointment. Public opinion appears at
once to have pointed out his Lordship as the fittest person
to undertake the government of Ireland; and before
anything could be known in that country of the intention
of Ministers, Lord Mornington wrote to the Marquis,
commending a special case to his consideration, under the
impression that he would certainly be selected for the
office. A passage in a subsequent letter of Lord Mornington's,
dated 4th of November, written upon the
occasion of Lord Buckingham's appointment, possesses
peculiar interest on account of the illustrious individual
to whom it refers. This is, perhaps, the earliest allusion
in the correspondence of the period to Arthur Wellesley,
whose name now appears for the first time emerging from
boyhood into that public life in which he was afterwards
destined to act so conspicuous a part. At this time, he
was little more than eighteen years of age.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I sincerely wish you the same success in Ireland which
attended your last Government; your only difficulty will be to
maintain the high character which your Administration bore, in
the minds of every description of people. You will certainly be
received by the sanguine expectations of the whole country;
and from my heart and soul I earnestly hope that you may
return home with the same popularity and credit that you carry
out. I must be lost to all feeling, if I did not take the warmest
interest in the honour and prosperity of your Government, and
if I did not acknowledge myself to be bound by the strongest
ties of friendship and gratitude to contribute everything within
my power to promote its strength, in any way in which you
may please to call upon me.</p>

<p>You may well believe with what pleasure I received your
appointment of my brother to a place in your family, not only
as being a most kind mark of your regard for me, but as the
greatest advantage to him. I am persuaded that under your
eye he will not be exposed to any of those risks, which in other
times have accompanied the situation he will hold. I can
assure you sincerely that he has every disposition which can
render so young a boy deserving of your notice; and if he does
not engage your protection by his conduct, I am much mistaken
in his character. My mother expects him every hour in
London, and before this time I should hope that he had himself
waited on you. Once more, my dear Lord, before I close this
part of my letter, let me thank you most warmly for this flattering
instance of your friendship. Grenville, I hope, has shown
you my letter, in which I declare that I would not have asked
you for this favour, knowing your inclination to attend to my
requests, and apprehending that you might suffer your regard
for me to interfere to the prejudice of your Government; but
certainly this object for my brother was very near my heart,
and I accept it with a gratitude proportioned to the anxiety
with which I desired it, and to the most friendly manner in
which it has been given.</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span></p>

<p>The rest of the letter is filled with recommendations of
other persons&mdash;Hobart, Captain Fortescue, Jephson, who
had the care of the stables at the Castle, an office which
he had held for twenty years, and of whom Lord Buckingham
seems to have received some unfavourable impressions,
a Mr. Mockler, for whom Lord Mornington solicited
"anything above &pound;70 a year in a <i>genteel line</i>" (his own
phrase), and others. In another letter, dated 8th of
November, Lord Mornington, in a postscript, refers again
to the appointment of his brother Arthur.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I am sorry to find by a letter from my mother to-day, that
her extreme anxiety to get my brother into your family induced
her to make an application to you through W. Grenville on the
subject; I have already stated, that I never would have urged
this point, though I accept the favour from you with the
utmost gratitude. However, the eagerness which has led her
to this step, affords a sufficient proof of the satisfaction which
she must feel, in the very kind manner in which you had anticipated
her wishes.</p></div>

<p>The answer of Lord Buckingham to the numerous
requests of Lord Mornington, evinces the promptitude of
his desire to promote the wishes of his correspondent.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I have desired that your brother may buy his men from a
Charing Cross crimp, that he may not be spoilt by recruiting,
and am happy that I can name him as aide-de-camp. Your
Mr. Jephson is a &mdash;&mdash;, I will not say what, but knowing him
to be so, I may possibly keep him. Your Mr. Mockler shall
be ensign as soon as I can make him one, or some other <i>genteel
thing</i>. Your Mr. Elliot may be chaplain, if he likes being at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
the tail of my list, with the impossibility of ever getting anything.</p></div>

<p>And so on through the rest of the catalogue.</p>

<p>The following letters from Mr. Grenville refer to personal
matters, and chiefly to the promotion of Dr. Cleaver,
which Lord Buckingham was anxious to obtain, and which
is promised in a subsequent letter from Mr. Pitt.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>MR. W. W. GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.</p>

<p>Whitehall, Nov. 7th, 1787.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Brother</span>,</p>

<p>I have received your letter of yesterday. I do not know
what I can say on the subject, more than you will have learnt
from Pitt's letter. If you really feel disposed to insist on the
engagement, without waiting ten days to hear the difficulties
explained to you, or the solution proposed, I have no doubt,
from a thorough knowledge of Pitt's honour, that he will most
strictly and literally fulfil his promise, whatever the inconvenience
may be to himself. I have only to add, in answer to
one part of your letter, that you must recollect that Harley's
promotion, instead of being a breach of the rule, was in the
strictest adherence to it; and that Lord Lonsdale was obliged
to make his recommendation to Carlisle conformable to it.</p>

<p>I saw Orde to-day, who, understanding that you do not
come up till the 17th, returns to Bath, as he was waiting here
only to see you. He pressed so much to know his successor,
that I thought there could be no impropriety in telling him in
confidence, especially as he will see Fitzherbert at Bath, and
may there settle with him the variety of private arrangements
which must be adjusted between them.</p>

<p>I enclose a letter from Mornington. I have not seen Captain
Fortescue, as I have been out of town till to-day.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span></p>

<p>I have just seen Sir James Erskine, who is come with a
message from St. Leger, to say that he has the disposal of the
vacant seat at Doneraile, which he is desirous of offering to you
for your secretary. I referred him to you; and when you come
to town will tell you more about it.</p>

<p>Ever most affectionately yours,<br/>
<span class="smcap">W. W. Grenville</span>.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>MR. W. W. GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.</p>

<p>Whitehall, Nov. 8th, 1787.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Brother</span>,</p>

<p>I can with the greatest sincerity assure you that I am not by
any means indifferent to the point in question on Cleaver's
account, as far as his situation can be affected by it; but that if
I were entirely so, the interest which you take in it would be
abundantly sufficient to secure, not only my most active exertions,
but also my warmest wishes in support of whatever you
may have to desire with respect to it. But you cannot, I am
sure, think me unreasonable if I do most seriously and earnestly
desire that you will not press me to convey to Pitt
sentiments founded on what I conceive to be a total misapprehension
of the subject, and relating to a business on which he
so naturally expects to converse with you, and which, whatever
may be its ultimate arrangement, can neither be forwarded nor
delayed for many weeks after your return to town. If, when
you come back, you persist in your opinion that it will be
proper to decline all conversation on the subject, it is perfectly
easy for you to express that opinion; or, if you wished it, I
would certainly not decline to convey your sentiments, however
I might differ from them. I should undoubtedly think
that such a determination was neither handsome towards Pitt,
nor at all calculated to promote Cleaver's interest; but it would
then rest with you, and no inconvenience will certainly have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
arisen from the delay. From my delivering such a message in
the present moment, I know nothing that could arise but a total
interruption of all confidence where it is most necessary. To
my feelings, nothing could justify such a proceeding but a direct
breach of engagement; and, in the present instance, you have
received a direct assurance of a determination to fulfil the
engagement if you think proper to insist upon it.</p>

<p>The other particulars are of much less importance. Pretyman's
appointment was never denied to be a breach of the rule.
Harley's tended to restore the equality which that had interrupted.
Grisdale was an Oxford man; I did not therefore
state the refusal of him to have been made on that ground,
but I repeat that Lord Lonsdale was expressly told that no
recommendation of a Cambridge man would be accepted.</p>

<p>I have nothing to do with Doneraile, except in a promise of
conveying to you the proposition on the subject, as it was made
to me by Sir James Erskine, who is a friend of St. Leger's. I
do not clearly understand from your letter whether you comply
with Fortescue's request. If you do, it would be a charity to
let him know it, as he is remaining in London. I am much
surprised at Mr. Griffith's delay.</p>

<p>There is every appearance that the Dutch negotiation is
going on prosperously; so much so, that it is even not impossible
that we may have the treaty by the meeting of Parliament,
which would unquestionably be very desirable.</p>

<p>Adieu, my dear brother,<br/>
Believe me ever most sincerely and affectionately yours,<br/>
W. W. G.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>MR. W. W. GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.</p>

<p>Whitehall, Nov. 14th, 1787.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Brother</span>,</p>

<p>I enclose you a letter from Sir William Bowyer, who seems<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>
frightened out of all the senses he ever possessed. I take it
for granted it is not your intention he should serve, or that
there will be no harm in putting him out of his alarm as soon
as possible.</p>

<p>I wait only for your return to town to lay before you a list of
applications, which would completely fill up your family, and
supply any deficiencies in Orde's list. Every man who knows
me by sight, who remembers my name at Eton or Oxford, or
who voted for me in Bucks, is to be immediately made either a
chaplain or an aid-de-camp, or is to have a snug place of &pound;1,000
a-year to begin with, as Sir Francis Wronghead says. As I
know you can have no difficulty in complying with all these
requests, I do not answer them till I see you, in order that I
may then inform them all of your entire acquiescence.</p>

<p>Seriously, I have been pestered with applications beyond all
imagination, but have the satisfaction of not having received
one about which I have any other desire than that of being able
to say that I have mentioned them to you, and have received an
answer, informing me of the impossibility of complying with
them.</p>

<p>Harris writes word that, with great activity, the Alliance may
possibly be concluded before Christmas.</p>

<p>Ever most affectionately yours,<br/>
W. W. G.</p>

<p>Everything else going on very peaceably, notwithstanding
newspapers and stock-jobbers.</p></div>

<p>Lord Buckingham arrived in Dublin on the 16th of
December, and his reception is described as having been
highly enthusiastic.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="year-1788" id="year-1788"></a>1788.</h2>

<h3>Irish Correspondence&mdash;The India Declaratory Bill&mdash;Trial of
Warren Hastings&mdash;Contemplated Changes in the Administration&mdash;The
King's Interference in Military Appointments&mdash;The Irish
Chancellorship&mdash;The King's Illness&mdash;Views of the Cabinet
Respecting the Regency.</h3>


<p>On the 1st of January, 1788, Lord Buckingham transmitted
to the Ministers a copy of the speech he proposed
for the opening of the Irish Parliament on the 17th. He
threw himself at once into the labours of his Government,
which, judging from the multitude of topics that pressed
upon his time, and the conscientious consideration he
bestowed upon them, were onerous and absorbing. His
correspondence of this period is very voluminous, and
embraces in detail an infinite variety of subjects. The
universal reliance which was placed in his justice and
toleration, drew upon him petitions and complaints from
all manner of people. Sometimes advice upon the
state of the nation was volunteered from an obscure
student, who, looking out upon the great world through
the "loopholes of retreat," imagined he had discovered a
panacea for all public evils; sometimes the claim, real or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
imaginary, of individuals upon the patronage of Government
were urged with vehemence, or humility, according
to the temperament of the claimant, but in most cases,
with the sanguine eagerness of the national character; in
one instance, a retired Quaker, animated by the best intentions,
suggests a project for protecting the mail-coaches
against robbers, by sending them to their destination
under an escort of dragoons; and in another, a citizen
begs the personal interference of the Lord-Lieutenant
concerning a cheat which was put upon a poor country-boy,
who had been buying some second-hand article at an
old furniture shop in Dublin. To all the applications, of
every kind, that were addressed to him, Lord Buckingham
paid scrupulous attention, bringing to the discharge of the
most trivial duties of his station the same diligence and
earnestness he bestowed on the most important.</p>

<p>The majority of the questions relating to Ireland, which
are thrown up in the course of his political and public
correspondence, possess little attraction at this distance
of time, having reference chiefly to fugitive topics, such as
the augmentation of the army (a measure which his Lordship
held to be of paramount necessity), the reduction of
expenditure, and the conflicts of local parties; but,
although the immediate importance of these questions
has long since passed away, they place in a strong historical
light the difficulties the Viceroy had to contend
with, in his government of a country rent by intestine
factions and overrun by corrupt agencies. In the midst
of the feuds and jealousies that plunged both the Parliament
and the people into a condition of constant tumult,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
there were some gleams of a nobler spirit; and wherever
they appeared, whether on the part of the friends or the
opponents of the Government, Lord Buckingham was
ready to recognise their purifying and regenerating influence.
From a mass of letters bearing upon personal
matters, and illustrative of the conduct of individuals who
occupied conspicuous positions, the following may be
selected as deserving special notice, on account of the
subsequent celebrity of one of the writers. Mr. Curran
sat at this time in the Irish Parliament for a borough of
Mr. Longfield's; and when Lord Buckingham assumed
the government of Ireland for the second time, Mr. Longfield,
being desirous to contribute all the parliamentary
strength he could to the service of the Administration,
endeavoured to secure the support of Mr. Curran. It
was a matter of some delicacy on both sides. The nominee
was generally understood to take the colour of his politics
from the owner of the borough; and although no explicit
compact could have been entered into in such cases, and
was distinctly disclaimed in the present case, yet it was
usually felt that the relation between the patron and the
member implied a general harmony of opinion, which
precluded the latter from the assertion of an independent
line of policy. Such were the circumstances under which
the subjoined correspondence took place. The spirit of
independence it displays is equally honourable to all parties.
At the date of these letters Lord Buckingham's first session
had just commenced; and it is scarcely necessary to add,
that Mr. Curran took his seat amongst the opponents of
his Lordship's Administration.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>MR. LONGFIELD TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.</p>

<p>Jan. 21st, 1788.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My Lord</span>,</p>

<p>The candour with which I met your Excellency on your
arrival in this kingdom, received, I hope, your entire approbation.
Under that idea, I hold myself obliged to the continuance
of it.</p>

<p>Since my arrival in town, I have not been so happy as to
make such an impression on Counsellor Curran as I wished to
do, and in justice to your Excellency's Administration, he
ought to have received. After many exertions, in order to
induce him to act as I intended to do, I received the enclosed
letter. For my own satisfaction, and to continue the same
candid confidence to your Excellency, I beg leave to submit it
to your perusal. My heart claims this trouble from you, as
my own justification. My head may err, but not intentionally.
In reply, I have rejected the offer of the seat, begged to retain
his personal regards, and left him to decide entirely on his
political conduct as he should think proper.</p>

<p>As to Mr. Heatly, he is no longer my friend and pensioner:
he ranges under Lord Shannon.</p>

<p>All I can now say is, that Major Vewell, Colonel Longfield
and myself are ever ready to repose the utmost confidence in
your Excellency's Government: we will support your measures
with firmness and decision, during your Administration in
this kingdom.</p>

<p>I have the honour to be,<br/>
With the highest respect and esteem,<br/>
Your Excellency's most devoted and obedient humble servant,<br/>

<div class="blockquot"><p>MR. CURRAN TO MR. LONGFIELD.</p>

<p>Jan. 18th, 1788.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,</p>

<p>I sit down in compliance with your wish that I might explain
my sentiments on the subject of our conversation yesterday,
more fully than our situation would then permit.</p>

<p>When you first did me the honour of proposing to return me
into Parliament, I thought myself bound to be explicit on the
occasion, and I was so. I stated to you that the general
acceptance of such an offer, might naturally be considered to
imply a condition, on the person accepting it, of conforming in
his Parliamentary conduct with yours. I also stated to you at
large the reasons why I could not sit in the House of Commons
under the slightest implication of any such restraint, and I was
happy in finding you concur with me on that point, of which I
was perfectly satisfied by the warmth with which you disclaimed
any idea of your intending or wishing to restrain my freedom
by any condition whatsoever. The motives you were pleased to
assign for a conduct so very flattering and honourable to me,
were an additional incentive to my wishing rather to decline the
intended favour. I thought it beyond my merit, and I urged
you to confer it upon some other gentleman. These same
sentiments I repeated in many conversations I had with you
on the subject; but your friendly partiality persevered and
prevailed. I do not dwell on these facts from any supposition
that you have forgotten them, which could not be consistent
with the very honourable solicitude with which I know you have
always borne testimony to them, and to my independence. But
I recal them to show you that I also remember them, as forming
the principal ground of the obligation to you, which I uniformly
felt, and professed.</p>

<p>From that period to the present, we have concurred in
sentiments and acted together. I now understand from you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>
that you have engaged to support the present Administration.
From what I have heard of His Excellency, and what I know
of you, I cannot doubt that you have acted consistently with
the public interest, and your own honour; but being an utter
stranger to the principles or the measures which Administration
may adopt, I feel that I could not, without hazarding the
sacrifice of my principles or my character, follow your example
in that point, however I respect it. I see clearly, that while we
remain as at present, we shall both of us be exposed to that
calumny, which you find has even already been put into motion
against us. Were I to go to the House and vote as you may&mdash;for
on any ordinary occasion I could not forget my regards for
you so much as to vote against you&mdash;it would be relinquishing
that independence which I have always asserted. If I stayed
away totally, I should be accused by my enemies, of violating
an engagement that never existed, or I should be said by yours
to cast upon you, and for such causes as they would not fail
to invent, the heaviest of all censures, the tacit condemnation of
a friend. And, however anxious each would be to do justice
to the other, calumny would drown our voices, or malignity affect
not to believe us. Thus circumstanced, I should, were that
practicable, request you to reassume that seat, which I could no
longer fill with honour to you, or safety to myself. Though
this cannot be done directly, yet we may obtain the same end
by an expedient tantamount in effect, and which I mentioned to
you yesterday, that is by your permitting me to procure a return
for a friend of yours for the remainder of this Parliament, or
to give him such a sum as may enable him to procure it, when
there shall be an opportunity. Let me assure you, I am infinitely
obliged by your manner of receiving this proposal, as it shows
me that you are too well persuaded of my regard and respect
for you to suppose it made with any, the remotest view of
putting an end to our intimacy or friendship. On the contrary,
I ask it as a favour, from that very friendship, and because I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
am anxious to preserve it inviolate. Neither am I afraid of
being thought uneasy under a sense of obligation, or desirous
of being freed from it by the paltry expedient of a partial
compensation. I think you know me too well to suspect me of
so sordid an idea, and on your vindication of me as to that, will
I cordially rely. I cannot but add that I am happy in making
this proposition at a time when the popularity of the Administration
you have acceded to, must evince to you and to everybody,
that my object is perfectly disinterested. The funds of
opposition, if in fact such a thing exists, you will allow are too
low at present to have much temptation for a purchaser.</p>

<p>Believe me, my dear Sir, with great truth and regard, your
much obliged and affectionate humble servant,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John P. Curran</span>.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM TO MR. LONGFIELD.</p>

<p>Dublin Castle, Jan. 23rd, 1788.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>

<p>Your letter, enclosing one from Mr. Curran, reached me at a
moment when my attention was taken up with other business,
else I should have immediately answered it.</p>

<p>I am very sensible of the candour with which you have
declared your intentions of supporting me, and of your exertions
to induce Counsellor Curran to act with you in that line of
conduct. The offer of the seat, on his part, is handsome; as is
likewise your refusal of it.</p>

<p>I am much honoured by the confidence which you have
shown me on this occasion, and have the honour to be,</p>

<p>Sir,<br/>
Your very obedient and faithful humble servant,<br/>
N.B.</p>

<p>Richard Longfield, Esq.</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span></p>

<p>The arrangement for the establishment of Arthur Wellesley
as one of the aide-de-camps to Lord Buckingham,
alluded to in a recent letter from Lord Mornington,
suffered an interruption on the threshold from a proposal
made by Sir George Yonge, then Secretary at War, for
reducing the gentlemen holding those appointments to
half-pay. Lord Mornington, who was still in England,
resented the proposal indignantly, and brought the affair
under the notice of the Lord-Lieutenant. He writes on
the 8th of January,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Sir George Yonge had retreated into Devonshire before I
received your letter; but I have ventured to disturb his retirement
by an epistle of four sides of paper, to which I could not
yet have received an answer. I cannot conceive what he can
mean by this man&oelig;uvre, because I cannot see any advantage to
him in the reduction of any, or of all your aide-de-camps to
half-pay; and I am clearly of opinion, that there is no argument
which can be drawn in favour of the reduction of any,
which will not equally apply to all. I do not exactly understand,
by the papers which I received from you, what was the
nature of his proposal with respect to the 9th and 10th companies.
I have threatened, that my brother shall join his
regiment in India. This business is now very unfortunate to
Arthur, as his men are now all raised, and he has concluded an
agreement for an exchange, which only waits the mighty fiat of
the Secretary at War. I fear he must wait for the decision of
that great character; for I think under the present circumstances
he cannot safely leave England. However, I hope the
Secretary will deign to temper his grandeur with a little
common sense in the course of a few days, and then I will
consign your aide-de-camp to you by the first mail-coach.</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span></p>

<p>Lord Mornington, however, had no necessity to carry
out his threat of sending his brother to India. That
service was reserved for a later day. Sir George Yonge's
project appears to have been over-ruled, at least so far as
Arthur Wellesley was concerned, and the young aide-de-camp
was duly forwarded to his post of honour. In the
month of April, Lord Mornington writes again to the
Viceroy, thanking him for the kindness with which he has
treated his <i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>My principal reason for intruding on you now, is to express
my warm and hearty thanks for your great kindness to my
brother, of which I have not only received the most pleasing
accounts from himself, but have heard from various other
quarters. You will easily be persuaded, that I must feel your
goodness to him as the strongest and most grateful instance of
your regard for me. I must also do my brother the justice to
assure you that he feels as he ought to do on this subject, and
that you have warmly attached him to you. All his letters
that I have seen, not only to me, but to many others totally
unconnected with you, speak the most sincere language of
gratitude and affection for the reception you have given him.
He also expresses great obligations to Lady Buckingham, whom
I must beg you to thank in my name.</p></div>

<p>Mr. Grenville's correspondence with his brother was
now resumed with the same activity as before, ranging
over every question of public moment affecting the foreign
and domestic policy of the country. One of the topics
which began to occupy a large space in the public mind
about the beginning of the year was the contemplated<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>
movement for the abolition of the Slave Trade. The
abstract justice of the abolition, and the practical difficulties
in the way of effecting it, were equally obvious to
Mr. Grenville.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The business of the Slave Trade is referred to the Committee
of Trade. It is a very extensive investigation, and by no means
a pleasant subject of inquiry at such a board, because I take it
the result will clearly be what one knew sufficiently without
much inquiry&mdash;that on every principle of humanity, justice,
or religion, the slave trade is unjustifiable, and that at the same
time it is, in a commercial point of view, highly beneficial,
though I believe not so much as those who are concerned in it
pretend. On this view of the question I have certainly formed
my opinion, that the duty of Parliament is that which would
be the duty of each individual sitting there, namely, to sacrifice
objects of advantage to principles of justice. It is, however,
a great question, and of no little embarrassment to Government,
who run the risk of offending a numerous and powerful body
of men. I am told that there is an idea of calling the county
of Bucks together, to petition as other counties have done.
This will be very distressing to me, because, although my
opinion is formed, it would not be very decent for me to declare
it publicly, while an inquiry is pending at the Board of which I
am a member.</p></div>

<p>The subject was new and startling at this time, and
Lord Buckingham took alarm at the notion of a sudden
and complete measure of abolition. Having communicated
his doubts to Mr. Grenville, the reply of the latter
expresses a general concurrence in his views.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span></p><div class="blockquot"><p>Our ideas do not seem very different as to the Slave Trade. I
never entertained an idea that we could liberate the slaves
actually in the Islands, except by some such gradual measure
as you mention. But I am very sanguine in thinking that a
law preventing the carrying any more slaves to the Islands in
British ships (the only vessels that can legally trade there)
may be passed and enforced without considerable difficulty or
danger.</p></div>

<p>Towards the end of January Lord Mornington writes:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>We are all very eagerly engaged in considering a plan for
the abolition of the Slave Trade, which is to be soon brought
forward by Wilberforce. I hear that Burke is to prove slavery
to be an excellent thing for negroes, and that there is a
great distinction between an Indian Begum and an African
Wowski.</p></div>

<p>That some of the supporters of the Administration did
not consider Mr. Wilberforce the fittest person to bring
forward the question is frankly avowed in several of these
letters. Sir William Young, a constant and lively correspondent,
communicates his apprehensions on this point
to Lord Buckingham. His letter is dated the 20th of
February.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The French have offered our people of Liverpool (hearing
that we are on the eve of surrendering our Slave Trade) no less
than &pound;5 per ton premium to carry on the trade between Africa
and the French islands. When Wilberforce intends to come
forward is not settled, nor what his precise motion. I
cannot help feeling its absurdity <i>d'avance</i>, knowing my friend
Wilberforce to be a mere utopian philanthropist on a subject
which a little needs the practical politician.</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span></p>

<p>On the 9th of May following, Mr. Pitt, taking the
question into his own hands, moved a resolution pledging
the House to the consideration of the Slave Trade in the
ensuing session. Upon this, Sir William Young remarks:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The Slave Trade, obviously from the debate on Friday last,
will be made an election tool to work at the Dissenters with,
and gain the hurra' of the lower people. When Pitt shall come
forward to unite humanity and justice with policy and the
public necessities, and produce early next session some measures
of legislation for the colonies, and of regulation in the
trade, I foresee the clamour will be "What! regulate rapine
and murder! and legislate slavery in the British dominions!"
and all of the measure, as to the abolition of the trade which is
wisely put by, will be artfully taken up to discredit what is
humanely done. And this is the mischief of leaving such
business to the good and brilliant, but little-wise or solid
Wilberforce, who did not know, that in a business of such
extent as to the interests of the public, their feelings should
not have been excited to go beyond the mode or degree of
practicable remedy to the evil; that to give hopes of something
is to render the full accomplishment more grateful; and that
to anticipate the most that can be done, is to render the doing
less thankless, and as nothing. Adopting the strongest wishes
for the full abolition of slavery and the Slave Trade, was it not
folly in the extreme to throw out the idea of full abolition
previous to investigation of how far it was possible to go, and
where a stop of necessity must be made. Wilberforce hath
everywhere canvassed addresses for total abolition!</p></div>

<p>These passages, collected from the Correspondence, possess
some historical value from their immediate bearing
upon the state and action of opinion, at the time when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>
this question was originally introduced into Parliament.
Wilberforce was confessedly not considered a practical politician,
and his support was regarded by Pitt with apprehension.
His sincerity was admitted by everybody, but
there seems to have been a strange want of confidence in
his judgment. By agitating the country for total abolition,
before the public had had an opportunity of investigating
the bearings of the question, he showed more
zeal than discretion, and seriously embarrassed the proceedings
of the Minister. Wilberforce had the best
intentions in the world, but, like other politicians, sometimes
erred in carrying them out.</p>

<p>Not the least charm of these letters is the insight they
afford into the characters of the principal persons concerned
in them; and the slightest passages that assist us
to a nearer view of men who occupied so large a space
in their own times, and whose actions enter into the
history of the country, have a distinct attraction in this
point of view.</p>

<p>Allusion has already been made to the sensitiveness of
Lord Buckingham on personal points of form and etiquette,
which sometimes disposed him to fancy discourtesy or
indifference where none was really contemplated. It can
hardly be supposed that this trait could have been generated
in the mind of a statesman of such tried ability
and acknowledged influence from any distrust in his
own powers, or in the high position he held amongst
his contemporaries; and it must, therefore, be regarded
entirely as a matter of temperament. It was the weakness
of a nature capable of the sincerest attachments,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>
and jealous of every appearance of neglect in those whose
regards it cherished. Between his Lordship and Lord
Sydney there existed a strict bond of friendship. It
had been tested in the struggles of public life, and
cemented by many interchanges of confidence in their
private relations. Lord Sydney, however, appears upon
some occasion to have forgotten, in his official capacity
as Secretary of State, the formality with which the Lord-Lieutenant
of Ireland should have been addressed, and to
have lapsed, perhaps unconsciously, into that familiar tone
which, no doubt, sat more easily upon him in writing to
his friend, Lord Buckingham. The particular subject is
of no importance; but, whatever it was, Lord Buckingham
was dissatisfied with his correspondent's style, and
indicated so much to him. Here is Lord Sydney's answer,
marked "private;" admirable as a specimen of excellent
feeling and indomitable good-humour.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>LORD SYDNEY TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.</p>

<p>Grosvenor Square, Feb. 6th, 1788.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Lord</span>,</p>

<p>I heartily congratulate you upon the success of two very
important questions, which has been determined so much to
the advantage of the public, and to the credit of your Lordship's
Administration. I should have been very sorry if the style of
any letter of mine should have had the effect of diminishing in
the least degree the pleasure which you must have received
from the news which had just reached you from the House of
Commons. I agree with you that forms must be observed, and
surely none more exactly than those which consist in the mutual<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>
respect and civility which ought to appear in the correspondence
between two of the principal offices of Government. In a
private one between the Marquis of Buckingham and Lord
Sydney, the latter will always be inclined to be as little punctilious
as any man living. But as to that in question, I must
say, that I had no reason to suppose that my style could seem
objectionable, when I had endeavoured to imitate that of the
letter to which mine was an answer. To leave this subject, you
may depend upon my being as cautious as possible in future,
to avoid any deviation from the usual form; but in the present
case, the King's leave of absence being already given, it is not
proper that any alteration should be made.</p>

<p>I have seen the Duchess of Rutland to-day for the first time
at her Grace's desire. She expressed herself in the strongest
terms of gratitude towards your Lordship, for your attention in
transmitting to her the extracts from the addresses of both
Houses of Parliament, as well as for your letter upon the subject.
Her manner and appearance was truly affecting, particularly
to one who has had a strong attachment to the Rutland
family all his life. She is very much pleased with the marks
of respect which have been shown by all ranks of people to the
memory of the poor Duke, and said that she must always love
Ireland. I never saw more propriety, or a more unaffected
general behaviour in my life.</p>

<p>I have finished Mr. Anselm Nugent's business to-day. I do
not think that His Majesty quite likes so total a dispensation
with an Act of Parliament; but agreed to it with great cheerfulness,
and with very gracious expressions of his desire to do
what was agreeable to you.</p>

<p>We have nothing new stirring, except the young ladies, two
of whom eloped the day before yesterday: Lady Augusta
Campbell with a son of Sir John Clavering's, and a daughter
of Sir H. Clinton's with a son of Mr. Dawkins's.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span></p>

<p>You will be glad to be released, and I am called to dinner.
Present my best respects to Lady Buckingham and Lord
Temple.</p>

<p>Believe me ever to be, with the greatest esteem and regard,</p>

<p>My dear Lord,<br/>
Your most obedient humble servant,<br/>
<span class="smcap">Sydney</span>.</p></div>

<p>The India Declaratory Bill, and the trial of Mr.
Hastings, were the great subjects which now engrossed
the attention of the Government and the country. Mr. Pitt
had just introduced the famous Declaratory Act, for the
purpose of conferring new and important powers on the
Board of Control, and explaining the provisions of his
former measure for the regulation of Indian affairs.
Against this Bill a most formidable opposition was
organized in the House of Commons, threatening, by its
numbers no less than by the weight of its objections,
to overthrow the Administration. The House was reminded
that Mr. Fox's Cabinet had fallen by a similar
measure; and it was endeavoured to be shown, not
without a considerable appearance of justification, that
the most odious features of that measure were revived
and exaggerated in the Bill now introduced by Mr. Pitt.
It is evident from Mr. Grenville's letter on this subject,
that, although Ministers disclaimed the resemblance thus
traced between the two plans, they regarded with no
inconsiderable apprehension the arguments founded upon
it, and the consequences they entailed. Lord Mornington
writes more hopefully, but his letter was written before
the decision which betrayed the defection of many of the
usual supporters of Government.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>LORD MORNINGTON TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.</p>

<p>Hertford St., March 4th, 1788.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Lord</span>,</p>

<p>As I know that William Grenville has not been quite well for
this day or two, and that he does not mean to write to you by
this post, I trouble you with a few lines, in order to give you
the earliest account of the business of last night. Erskine and
Rous came to the bar in support of the Petition from the
Directors against the East India Declaratory Act, and there
was a great muster of the forces of Fox, Lord North, Lord
Lansdowne, and of the refractory directors, with every appearance
that some great exertion was to be made. Erskine made the
most absurd speech imaginable: and after having spoke for near
three hours, he was taken ill, and obliged to leave the bar. Rous
was then heard; and when he had finished, Erskine (who had
dined in the coffee-room with the Prince of Wales, and been
well primed with <i>brandy</i>), returned to the charge, I understand
at the express desire of His Royal Highness. Erskine now
spoke for near two hours, and delivered the most stupid, gross,
and indecent libel against Pitt, that ever was imagined; the
abuse was so monstrous, that the House <i>hissed</i> him at his
conclusion. After this, Rous proposed to produce some letters
from the Treasury and the Board of Control, as evidence of the
construction of Pitt's East India Bill; on this question we
divided&mdash;for receiving the evidence, 118; against, 242. The
Lansdownes divided against us; Pitt then moved himself for
the letters. The Bill was read a second time, and is committed
for Wednesday, when another attack will be made.</p>

<p>We reckon this a great triumph. You cannot conceive the
clamour that has been attempted to be raised on this occasion;
and the question of the new Act is certainly well contrived for
the union of the great men whom I have mentioned. It seemed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span>
great mismanagement in the Opposition to divide on the
question of evidence, instead of pressing an adjournment, on
which they might have made a much better appearance. It is
hardly to be expected that we shall be quite as strong on the
question of the Bill itself; but you know the effect of a great
majority, even in preliminary questions, on the main subject.</p>

<p>Pitt took no sort of notice of Erskine's Billingsgate.</p>

<p>I will write to you after Wednesday, and shall then have
some other points to state to you. I am much obliged to you
for your kind attention to my Windsor job; but I beg you to
consult your own convenience in it, as it is not at all material
to me.</p>

<p>Hastings's trial you hear enough of from others. One fact
you cannot have heard, as we have but just received the accounts
at the Treasury; the expense of the counsel and solicitors attending
the management has already amounted to near &pound;5000,
the trial having lasted as yet only eleven days. There are five
counsel employed at ten guineas a-day, besides consultation
fees, and consultations are held every night. The first charge
is not yet finished. Make your own calculations of the
probable expense of this business, and of the patronage which
it has placed in the immaculate hands of the great orators.</p>

<p>Ever yours most affectionately,<br/>
<span class="smcap">Mornington</span>.</p>

<p>I cannot say how I rejoice in your success in Ireland&mdash;we
hear nothing but good news of you in every way, and even
from all quarters.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>MR. W. W. GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.</p>

<p>Whitehall, March 6th, 1788.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Brother</span>,</p>

<p>I am very sorry to send you, in return for all your good news,
an account from hence of a very different nature. By one of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>
those strange caprices, to which our friends in the House of
Commons are so peculiarly liable, they have taken the alarm
about our explanatory East India Bill; and although that Bill
does no more than declare that to be the law which not only
every man who can think, but every man who can read, must
agree with you is already the law on that subject, they have
suffered themselves to be persuaded that we are doing neither
more nor less than assuming to ourselves all the power of Fox's
Bill.</p>

<p>You must often have observed, that of all impressions the
most difficult to be removed, are those which have no reason
whatever to support them, because against them no reasoning
can be applied. Under one of these impressions; the question of
the Speaker's leaving the chair came on last night, and after
debating till seven this morning, we divided, in a majority of
only 57: Ayes, 183; Noes, 125. So many of our friends were
against us in this division, and that sort of impression runs so
strongly after such a display of weakness, that I have serious
apprehensions of our being beat either to-morrow on the
report, or Monday on the third reading. I need not tell you,
that besides much real inconvenience and embarrassment, with
respect to the measure itself, such a defeat would be in the
highest degree disreputable to Government, the personal
opinions, conduct and character of every leading man in the
House of Commons on our side being involved in this discussion.
Add to this the impression in the country, where the people
will certainly be persuaded that this House of Commons would
not have rejected such a Bill, except on just and solid grounds.
We must, however, weather it as well as we can, and submit to
the consequences of an evil which, I think, you will agree with
me it was not easy to foresee. What hurt us, I believe,
materially last night was that Pitt, who had reserved himself to
answer Fox, was, just at the close of a very able speech of Fox's,
taken so ill as not to be able to speak at all, so that the House<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>
went to the division with the whole impression of our adversaries'
arguments, in a great degree, unanswered. I had spoken early
in the debate, and Dundas just before Fox. I think this is the
most unpleasant thing of the sort that has happened to us;
but I console myself with recollecting how many similar
disasters we have surmounted. I have seen nobody this morning
but apprehend that we shall certainly go on with the Bill,
as nothing, I think, would be saved by withdrawing it.</p>

<p>Till within this last day or two I have been much out of
order, and this, added to the hurry of this business for the last
week, has made it impossible for me to get an answer to your
queries. I fear it will be impossible for me to do it before Tuesday,
but you may depend upon my exerting myself as much as I can.</p>

<p>I do not agree at all with what I understand from Young to
be your opinion on the reduction of interest; holding with
Smith, that the hire of money, like that of any other commodity,
will find its level, and going even beyond him in
thinking the grounds on which he states such a measure to be
sometimes justifiable, such as will not support him on his own
principles. I have also a doubt, but of that you are a much
better judge than I can be, whether it is often desirable to hold
a neutrality on the part of Government with respect to such
questions. That, however, depends on circumstances, and I can
easily conceive such as would make that the only line you could
prudently adopt.</p>

<p>This has been the most sickly of all seasons with us.
Jemmy has been very ill, and is not recovered, though, I trust,
entirely out of all danger. Hester has also been seriously ill,
but is out again. I agree most entirely with Fitzgibbon, in
reprobating that some <i>lex et consuetudo</i> Parliament, which is to
supersede the good old common law of the land. Fox's whole
conduct and language has been singularly indecent.</p>

<p>Ever most affectionately yours,<br/>
W. W. G.</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span></p>

<p>It will be seen that Mr. Grenville complains of the
failure, on the part of the friends of the Government, in
answering the arguments of the Opposition. Amongst
those whose talents raised the highest expectations, only
to be disappointed in the moment of debate by want of
resolution, was Lord Mornington&mdash;subsequently distinguished
by the brilliancy and solidity of his orations.
Mr. Grenville elsewhere alludes to Lord Mornington's
intention of speaking from day to day, which he fears
he will suffer the session to pass over without carrying
into execution, and begs of Lord Buckingham to write
to him urgently on the subject. Lord Bulkeley gives

way, runs on about the prominent topics of the hour.

<div class="blockquot"><p>LORD BULKELEY TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.</p>

<p>Stanhope Street, March 10th, 1788.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Lord</span>,</p>

<p>Our politics have worn the most decided aspect till lately.
On last Wednesday, on the bringing in the Declaratory Bill of
the powers of the Board of Control, Mr. Pitt experienced a
mortification, not only from the abilities of those who oppose
him, but from the defection of some of his friends, and the luke-warmness
of others, that he has not experienced since he has
been a Minister. It was an awkward day for him, and he felt
it the more because he himself was low-spirited, and overcome
by the heat of the House, in consequence of having got drunk<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span>
the night before at your house in Pall Mall, with Mr. Dundas
and <i>the Duchess of Gordon</i>. They must have had a hard bout
of it, for even Dundas, who is well used to the bottle, was
affected by it, and spoke remarkably ill, tedious and dull. The
Opposition, therefore, made the most of their advantages, and
raked Pitt fore and aft in such a manner, as evidently made an
impression on him. I heard from our own friends that no
Minister ever cut a more pitiful figure.</p>

<p>These triumphs were, however, of short duration to the
Opposition, for on Friday Pitt made one of the best and most
masterly speeches he ever made, and turned the tables effectually
on Opposition, by acquiescing in such shackles as they chose to
put on the article of patronage, all which they had pressed from
an idea that Pitt on that point would be inflexible. This speech
of Pitt's infused spirit into his friends; Dundas spoke very
well, and, contrary to expectation, so did Scott and Macdonald.
Government kept up their numbers in the division,
and Opposition lost ten. I understand from all quarters that
last Friday was, considering all circumstances, as good as the
Wednesday before was <i>bad</i> for Government. Notwithstanding
this happy recovery, there is yet a heavy and severe clamour
against Dundas, and I shall not be surprised if his unpopularity
should very materially injure Pitt's character and Government.
It was by his influence that a Mr. Tierney was kept out of the
direction, and a Mr. Elphinstone brought in, which last has
turned out the most violent opposer and the most formidable
Government has had at the India House; and there is great reason
to think the other, if he had been supported, would have been
a friend, though that docs not seem clear. However, those two
men have been the most active and useful to the Opposition in
all the late contentions in Leadenhall Street, where Mr. Dundas
<i>ought</i> to have had a majority.</p>

<p>All this business has given Fox advantages, which he has
not neglected; and although Mr. Pitt may be secure as to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>
continuation of his power, yet the former has and will gain
character, as a firm and manly straightforward politician; which
the other begins to lose by nearly adopting the principles of a
Bill which he had reprobated and condemned. Devaynes tells
me that a few dozen of claret, and two or three dinners, would
have operated with many in the direction; but Rose and Steele
follow Pitt's example in that respect, and vote such company
boors not deserving of such notice.</p>

<p>Your brother William suffered a mortification last Wednesday,
which, I am told, has vexed him: the moment he got up to
speak, the House cleared as it used to do at one time when
Burke got up. I hope it proceeded from accident, for if it
continues it must hurt him very essentially. The day after he
was in uncommon low spirits, and croaked very much. There
seems a general complaint of Pitt's young friends, who never
get up to speak; and I am not surprised at their timidity, for
Fox, Sheridan, Burke, and Barr&eacute;, are formidable opponents on
the ground they now stand upon. Young Grey has not yet
spoke on either of these last days, and he is hitherto a superior
four-year-old to any of our side. I have kept Sir Hugh
Williams and Parry steady to their tackle; the latter, I think,
unless a judgeship comes soon, will not live much longer, not
being of an age or constitution to live for ever on expectation,
however good his may be, for I am assured he is to have the
first vacancy. What the event of Hastings's trial will be, I
cannot say; the prosecution is carried on with great ability and
acrimony, but hitherto the oral evidence has fallen short of the
expectations pronounced by the managers.</p>

<p>Fox made a severe attack on the Chancellor and the Court,
for which Lord Fortescue was near moving to have the words
taken down, and to adjourn to the House of Lords, but letting
the proper moment slip, he was advised not to resume it again
by the Chancellor and the Duke of Richmond. I think the
Chancellor, to a certain degree, provoked Fox's attack by a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>
speech the day before in the House of Lords, which everybody
said had better been left alone.</p>

<p>I dined last Friday with your brother Marquis; in talking of
Lord Fortescue, he said he heard he was a sensible man, and
asked me whether he stood on his own bottom, or whether he
was a follower of the Grenvilles. I felt the aim of his <i>gracious</i>
speech, and consoled myself with his dinner and the addition of
a new stock of mimicry of those I already possess of him. He
and all his Synod are violent against the new Declaratory Bill,
and are ready for any mischief against the present Government,
though they are the last who would benefit by a change. The
Prince of Wales takes an active part in opposition, and goes on
the same. The Duke of York in politics talks both ways, and,
I think, will end in opposition. His conduct is as bad as
possible; he plays very deep, and loses, and his company is
thought <i>mauvais ton</i>.</p>

<p>I am told the King and Queen begin now to feel "how
much sharper than a serpent's tooth it is to have an ingrate
child." When the Duke of York is completely <i>done up</i> in the
public opinion, I should not be surprised if the Prince of Wales
assumes a different style of behaviour; indeed, I am told he
already affects to say that his brother's style is too bad.</p>

<p>I am, my dear Lord,<br/>
Your affectionate and sincere<br/>
B.</p></div>

<p>The habits of the Prince and his brother were now
become matter of notoriety in the political circles, and in
the preceding January had attracted the observation of
Mr. Grenville, who thus spoke of them in a letter to
Lord Buckingham:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The Prince of Wales has taken this year very much to play,
and has gone so far as to win or lose &pound;2,000 or &pound;3,000 in a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span>
night. He is now, together with the Duke of York, forming a
new club at Weltzies; and this will probably be the scene of
some of the highest gaming which has been seen in town. All
their young men are to belong to it. Lord T. had even at
Oxford shown his turn, having been sent away for being concerned
in the Faro then. I leave you to form the conclusion.</p></div>

<p>Dundas's character, sketched in a sentence, and the
hazards of the Government arising from the Declaratory
Bill, are the chief points in the next communication from
the sprightly Lord Bulkeley.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>LORD BULKELEY TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.</p>

<p>Stanhope Street, March 26th, 1788.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Lord</span>,</p>

<p>On the whole, there is every appearance that the Declaratory
Bill has occasioned a temporary division in the Cabinet, and a
run against Dundas, and consequently against Pitt, who stands
a willing sponsor for his transgressions, and who supports him
through thick and thin. Dundas sticks to Pitt as a barnacle
to an oyster-shell, so that if he chose it he cannot shake him off,
and everybody believes he does not mean it, let what will be the
consequence, because he likes him, and really wants him in the
House of Commons; besides, there is no man who eats Pitt's
toads with such zeal, attention, and appetite, as Dundas,
and we all know the effect of those qualities. You, who know
the interior of things, must laugh at me for what I tell you,
but I only can tell you public appearances and opinions, all
which you may know to be perfectly false and untrue.</p>

<p>Many of the Opposition with whom I converse seem to think
a change of Government at a great distance, while the King
and Pitt are on good terms, and others are woefully disappointed
that all this late business has passed off so quietly, without Pitt<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span>
being out and Fox in. What the future consequences of the
Declaratory Bill may be to Pitt, I cannot pretend to divine; but
certainly it has brought him a temporary unpopularity, and has
hurt him in the public opinion. I own, for my own part, that
I think <i>Leadenhall Street</i>, sooner or later, will overthrow him,
as it did Fox; but in this opinion, I know I differ with <i>la
parent&eacute;</i>, who all swear to me, even the nervous Jemmy, that
Mr. Pitt has gained strength from the measure, both in Parliament
and with the public; such, likewise, is the opinion of
all Pitt's intimates. I wish I may be wrong, and shall be very
happy to be convinced that I am so.</p>

<p>B.</p></div>

<p>The ill health of Mr. Rigby, who held the appointment
of Master of the Rolls in Ireland, rendering it probable
that a vacancy would shortly occur in that office, the
friends of Mr. Grenville proposed that it should be given
to him, and that he should hold it as a sinecure&mdash;a mode
of reward for public services which was in accordance with
the practice of the period. There were some difficulties,
however, attending it, which did not escape the penetration
of Mr. Grenville. In the first place, it had become a
matter of discussion whether the successor of Mr. Rigby
should not be required to perform the duties of the office
in person, instead of being permitted to discharge them,
as heretofore, by deputy; in which event, Mr. Grenville
would have declined the situation. The second point
upon which he hesitated referred to the permanency of
the office. Some doubt arose on the construction of the
statutes as to whether a life patent of the office would
hold good; and the apprehension that a future Administration
might have it in their power to raise the question,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span>
weighed strongly with Mr. Grenville, who discusses the
subject minutely in his letters to Lord Buckingham. But
there was a third consideration of still greater importance.
Several changes were in contemplation in the Ministry.
Lord Howe, who was at the head of the Admiralty, had
latterly rendered himself extremely unpopular, and signified
his intention of resigning, and was only restrained from doing
so at once on the representations of Mr. Pitt, who wished
to take advantage of the circumstance for the purpose of
effecting other alterations in the composition of the Government.
Amongst the suggestions arising out of these proposed
movements, Lord Buckingham and Mr. Grenville
were severally named for the Admiralty; but neither of
them were disposed to accept it. Lord Buckingham
preferred the position he held in Ireland, and Mr. Grenville
held back, having looked for some time to the Seals of
the Home Department, for which he had been assiduously
qualifying himself, his ambition being constantly urged in
that direction by Lord Buckingham. The letter in which
he opens all these plans to his brother is affecting in its
appeal to those feelings of implicit trust and attachment
which existed so warmly between these distinguished men.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>MR. W. W. GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.</p>

<p>Whitehall, April 1st, 1788.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Brother</span>,</p>

<p>I am extremely obliged for the trouble you have been so
good as to take about the mode in which it will be most
advisable to frame the grant of Rigby's office, in case of its
becoming vacant. I have consulted Pitt upon the subject, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>
his opinion entirely agrees with mine, that the present form is
much preferable to the other; for this, amongst other reasons,
that a grant of a judicial office, to be held during good behaviour,
might be vacated on account of non-administration of
justice, or even of non-residence in the kingdom. He says
that, after what has passed with the King, there can clearly
be no difficulty whatever when the case arises; and that it will
be better not to open it previously to Lord Sydney, as it might
by that means become a subject of conversation previous to its
taking place, which it is very desirable to avoid. I imagine, by
what I now hear from Bath, that it cannot be very long before
the event happens. I shall certainly be on the spot, and will
immediately take the necessary steps for having the warrant
sent over to you; after which you may expect to see me as soon
as possible, unless it should be necessary that the admission
should take place in Term time, which I will trouble you to
ascertain. It would, I think, be very advantageous to me, in
case of future discussions which may arise on this subject, if
you could procure from the Chancellor and Lord Earlsfort, and
perhaps Carleton (when the event happens), written opinions
that the making it an efficient <i>judicial</i> office would be attended
with no advantage or benefit. It would still remain necessary
that some officer should be appointed to have custody and
charge of the Rolls; and the only questions then would be,
whether such an office was one fit to be made the sort of
sinecure which Parliament here have admitted ought to exist
as a reward of public service, and whether your humble servant
was a fit object for such reward.</p>

<p>The point which I was desirous of mentioning to you in
cypher relates to my having been informed by Pitt, a few days
before I wrote to you, that Lord Howe has intimated an intention
of resigning his office at the close of this session. The
particular reason for secrecy is, that it is of the utmost importance
that this should not be publicly known till a new arrangement<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span>
is framed; but especially not till after the motion on the
subject of the late promotion is completely disposed of. Notwithstanding
this intimation, and the resolution which Lord
Howe appears to have taken, Pitt thinks it not impossible that
when the time for carrying it into execution draws nearer, he
may be induced to remain. Pitt feels it a point of the utmost
importance that he should, notwithstanding the sort of objections
which exist against him, and of which you are perfectly
apprized. But if he retires, there will be the utmost difficulty
in finding a proper person to supply his place. I apprehend,
that even before your appointment to Ireland you had made up
your mind on the subject; but that you would certainly not be
inclined to quit your present situation for one in so many
respects less agreeable, particularly at this moment. I trust,
however, that if you feel the least hesitation, or doubt, in your
mind, you will immediately let me know it, in order that I may
take the proper steps. If your decision remains the same, I
know no person at all fit for the employment that can take it.
The most likely person to be fixed upon is, I think, Lord Hood;
but there are great objections to him. Whatever he may be in
the Navy, which I know not, he is very far from being popular
in the House of Commons; and what is worse, he has spoken
there, whenever he has opened his lips, with a degree of indiscretion
which has been distressing, even in his present situation,
but which would be absolutely intolerable if he were to answer
for the execution of so responsible an office, made, as it certainly
will be, one of the great objects of attack on the part of
Opposition. This will make it necessary to send him up to the
House of Lords, for which he has neither fortune nor calibre
sufficient. It has been a question with Pitt and myself,
whether it would be possible for me to accept of it. At one
time, he appeared much disposed to this; but I must confess
that my mind has never gone to it at all. The situation would
unquestionably be highly flattering to me, at my time of life,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>
and in my rank, &amp;c. The patronage annexed to it is so considerable
as to be a real object, in a political point of view, to
any person engaged in a public line of life, where the acquisition
of friends is always an important point. Add to this, the
opportunity of distinguishing oneself in a department entirely
separate from all others, and the temptation is certainly very
great. But I feel two material, and as they now strike me,
insuperable objections. First, I think it is not prudent for
a person who has already been put forward beyond what many
people think his pretensions entitle him to, and who has still
much way to make for himself, to incur the risk of shocking
and revolting the feelings of almost every one, but those who
are most partial to him, by accepting a situation for which he
must be thought so little qualified, and which will be judged so
much above his rank, either in point of general situation in the
country, or with respect to any official situation in which he has
yet been engaged. Besides this, I am unwilling&mdash;after having
been endeavouring for four or five years to qualify myself, in
some degree, for almost any other line of public service&mdash;that
my first ostensible <i>d&eacute;but</i> should be in one where I should have
the first A B C to learn.</p>

<p>It is on these grounds that I have discouraged the idea when
Pitt threw it out to me, and I think they have had weight with
him. I have no doubt, that as far as respects my own interest
only, they are well founded; and that it will be infinitely more
advantageous to me to go on as I now am, waiting for such
events as may happen to open to me other objects, which I
could accept with less hazard. The same considerations operate,
also, with a view to the general interests of the system of
Government in which I am embarked. If I could essentially
serve that, even at a greater personal hazard than this, I should
certainly feel myself bound to do it. But the very same circumstances
which would make my appointment hurtful to my
own character in the present moment, would make it prejudicial<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>
to the general credit of Pitt's Government; and the
consequences of any failure would hardly be more injurious
to myself, personally, than to the Administration of which I
should then form a part. I have had an explanation with
Pitt, in the course of these discussions, on the subject of
Lord Sydney's office. He told me that he was unwilling to
remove him abruptly, without the means of making him, at
the same time, some sort of compensation; but that, whenever
any such opportunity offered, he should willingly and eagerly
embrace it. Lord Hardwicke's life, Barr&eacute;'s, the Duke of
Montagu's, Orde's and the Duke of Bolton's, with some others,
were mentioned as holding out no unreasonable or distant
prospect of such an arrangement. And I can with perfect
sincerity say to you&mdash;to whom I think aloud&mdash;that I am by
no means desirous that the interval should be so much
shortened, as to make the appointment immediate. I am in
the train of making myself fitter for it: in the enjoyment of
as much confidence as that office ever could give me, and with
the consciousness of being admitted to many opportunities of
doing real service to the Government that I act with. My
present income is sufficient&mdash;such an appointment would not
in reality increase it&mdash;and your goodness holds out to me a
near prospect of that future independence, which was the only
thing wanting to make my present situation perfectly happy.
You see how little temptation I have to exchange it even for
that to which I have hitherto looked; but much more for that
which is so unexpectedly put within my reach, but which is
attended with so many hazards to myself, and to the general
system of Administration.</p>

<p>I much wish to receive your opinion on this whole subject,
not only as it is connected with myself, but as to the means of
finding any other person to undertake the office supposing me
out of the question. It is perfectly understood that the Duke
of Grafton would not accept it, which I certainly consider as a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span>
very fortunate circumstance. With respect to yourself, I have
written the whole of what is above; and have listened to any
conversation on the subject, only in the idea that your opinion
will remain the same. I feel too much confidence in your good
opinion of me, to think it necessary to take up your time in
saying what you must unquestionably feel, that no conception
of competition on this point could ever enter into my head;
and that, even if I have taught myself to look to other situations
to which you have so much better a claim, it has only been in
consequence of what you have said to me on that subject, and
subject always to any alteration in your feelings with respect
to it.</p>

<p>I am prevented from saying more than a few words on the
different questions you ask. I mentioned to you, in my other
letter, the line which has been taken here with respect to the
Russian fleet, and to their application for transports. The same
line ought certainly to be followed in Ireland; but I think it
would be very important, for your own security, in so delicate a
business, that you should, whenever you receive any intimation
of anything of the sort being likely to occur in Ireland, immediately
state the particular point to Lord Sydney, in order to
receive precise orders upon it, for you see the line of distinction
which we draw here is a nice one.</p>

<p>Our Dutch alliance has passed the States of Holland, where
alone any difficulty was apprehended, and will probably be
signed in about a week. It will be immediately followed by a
treaty, by which Prussia and we shall bind ourselves to guarantee
to each other our engagements with Holland; but this
treaty will not extend to any general alliance between this
country and Prussia. The reason for this is, the apprehension
that such an alliance would rivet the connection between the
two Imperial Courts and France. In the meantime, there is an
entire and perfect understanding between this Court and that
of Berlin. We have no very accurate knowledge of the views of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span>
Spain. She is certainly arming, though to much less extent
than is talked of. I imagine that France is trying to persuade
her to acquiesce in the Porte's being compelled to submit to the
present demands of the two Imperial Courts, which seem confined
to Oxacow, Belgrade, and some pecuniary compensation
for the expense incurred. But I think the Porte will clearly
not submit to this, till she has tried the success of one campaign;
and what part Spain may take in this event it is not
easy to say.</p>

<p>Our accounts from India, by the 'Ravensworth,' are in
general, very good; but we are a little uneasy, on account of
Tippoo, who had made peace with the Marattas, and was
collecting his forces with a view of attacking the Nizam, or
the Raja of Gravancore, whom we must protect, or the Camatre
itself. Campbell was preparing for him; and I have little
doubt of the event; but the offence and mischief are formidable
to us.</p>

<p>I have just received your letter of the 2nd, with the usquebaugh,
for which I am much obliged to you. I think there
can be no question of the King's acquiescence, and the mentioning
it to him now might set him talking. I have been
hindered, by a variety of accidents, from sending this letter off
before. It has been written at five or six different times.</p>

<p>Adieu, my dear brother,<br/>
Believe me ever most sincerely and affectionately yours,<br/>
W. W. G.</p>

<p>We have the same accounts from many different quarters, as
that which Miles sends you. The idea is certainly much talked
of on the continent; but I have no faith in it. France is, I
think, evidently in no better condition for war now than last
year. Their annual <i>compte</i>, which was promised for January
in every year, is not yet out. The report is, that the deficiency<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span>
has been found much greater than was ever imagined. Our
revenue is most prosperous.</p></div>

<p>Lord Buckingham appears to have pressed his views
respecting the Home Office so earnestly upon Mr. Grenville,
that the latter, some months afterwards, grew a little
impatient of his zeal. The obstacle was, how to provide
for Lord Sydney.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I cannot (says Mr. Grenville, writing in September), even if I
wished it, drive Lord Sydney from his situation, without such
an opportunity as has not yet presented itself, and may not for
a considerable time to come. Even if that were done, I am by
no means clear that the difficulty would be removed.</p></div>

<p>The subject of the Rolls is resumed in subsequent
letters.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>MR. W. W. GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.</p>

<p>Whitehall, April 5th, 1788.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Brother</span>,</p>

<p>Since I have sent off your messenger this morning, I have
had some further conversation with Pitt about the Mastership
of the Rolls, which is expected to be vacant every hour. A
considerable difficulty arises from this circumstance, that Sir
Lloyd Kenyon has discovered, since he has held the English
office, that the sale of the places, from which a part of his profit
arose, is illegal; and he has, in consequence of this, resolved to
give the offices away, instead of selling them. The doubt
arises under a statute of Richard II.; and after such a man as
he has decided it against himself, it would neither be creditable,
nor even safe, for me to persevere in the old practice.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span></p>

<p>This makes me think it considerably better, that you should
endeavour to negotiate an exchange for me with some person
on your side of the water, who may not be troubled with the
same scruples. Pitt is to see Kenyon on Monday; and has
promised to inquire more particularly into this point. I shall
not deliver your letter to Lord Sydney till I hear again from
you upon it. If it was not for the difficulty of two re-elections,
I should think the best way would be, that I should take the
Rolls immediately, and take my chance with respect to any
exchange that I could make afterwards; but that, I fear, cannot
now be done.</p>

<p>I will write to you again, when I hear from Pitt what he has
learnt from Kenyon.</p>

<p>Ever most affectionately yours,<br/>
W. W. G.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>MR. W. W. GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.</p>

<p>Whitehall, April 21st, 1788.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Brother</span>,</p>

<p>I have this morning received yours of the 18th enclosing the
recommendation during pleasure. I am not a little distressed
at this circumstance, as I apprehend, from what you mention
about the Chancellor, that your destination of the office will
immediately become public. I am unable as yet, under these
circumstances, to satisfy my mind as to delivering or keeping
back the letter to Lord Sydney; but as I thought it necessary
that he should have your private letter, I called upon him with
that, and mentioned to him my wish of keeping back the other,
at least for the present, in order that I may have time to think it
over, and to consult Pitt upon it. But my present disposition
is, I think, to withhold it till I can hear again from you, in
answer to my letter of Saturday.</p>

<p>My opinion on the subject itself remains entirely the same.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span>
If the grant is made during pleasure what ground can there be
for thinking that another Government would not instantly create
it; especially after it has become, as it probably must, a ground
of some popular clamour, and after that specific office has been
in a manner applied for by their friend the Duke of Leinster.
Surely, under those circumstances, it can never be worth while,
either on your account or even on my own, that I should accept
an object which would only give me about &pound;1,000 per annum
in the very situation in which I do not want it. The arrangement
with Hutchinson, or almost any other, appears to me
infinitely preferable. On the whole, however, I leave it for your
determination; but I think, unless any fresh inconvenience from
the delay, beyond what I now see, occurs to my mind, that I
shall postpone taking any step in it till I have your answer to
my former letter.</p>

<p>As to the state of things here, I know not well what to write.
I have very little expectation of our not being beat whenever the
Navy Promotion is again brought in question; and what the
consequence of such a defeat is to be, I profess not to be
prophet enough to foretel. I do not think that people in
general are aware of the extent and importance of the blow;
but it will not the less have its full effect when it comes. You
will not wonder, therefore, that I look forward with no very
pleasing reflections to it, and that even that circumstance should
make me particularly anxious that the present opportunity
may be the means of securing to me something more permanent
than any Government in this country seems likely to be.</p>

<p>Adieu, my dear brother,<br/>
Ever most affectionately yours,<br/>
W. W. G.</p>

<p>You will have seen Sir G. Howard's speech, and will hear
much nonsensical speculation upon it. We have no suspicions
of that nature.</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span></p>

<p>Whitehall, April 29th, 1788.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Brother</span>,</p>

<p>I have just received your letter of the 25th. You will have
observed by my last letter, that I have not delivered the recommendation,
but that I called upon Lord Sydney with your
private letter, in order to mention the circumstance to him, and
to desire him to say nothing of it till he heard again from me.
He behaved with great kindness to me, and assured me he would
do in this business exactly what I wished. My own ideas at
present incline to taking the Rolls for life: if any other solution
should offer while you are in Ireland, it will be always equally possible
to arrange it; and if not, I think the question of the legality
will bear at least a great deal of argument. My own opinion
rather is, that I could support such a patent against anybody.
But at all events it will be a much more difficult undertaking to
remove me, and one less likely to enter into the mind of our
adversaries, than if the grant expressly gave the office only
during pleasure. I can lose nothing by taking it for life, even
if such a grant is bad, because that will at least be equal to a
tenure during pleasure; and if it is good, as I think precedents,
and even the true construction of the Act will make it, I have
attained the object which your friendship is anxious to secure
to me. You will observe that the argument of vacating by
non-residence does not apply to a grant for life, <i>with exception
of the ministration of justice</i>; but to a grant, <i>quamdiu se
bene gesserit</i>, under the statute which enables the King to grant
<i>judicial</i> offices in that form. The latter would clearly be forfeited
by non-residence, and I strongly think that the former is
good in law.</p>

<p>I mention this, because you appear to feel considerable difficulties
in any exchange, and I am unquestionably very anxious<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span>
that an arrangement in which I fear you must, at all events,
sacrifice a good deal to my objects, may be attended with as
little additional inconvenience to you as possible.</p>

<p>Our friends are sanguine as to the event of Bastard's motion,
which is to come on to day. As this opinion is the result of
a personal canvass, I hope it is tolerably founded; but I am not
enough acquainted with the particulars to give any opinion of
my own upon it. Only I think I see amongst our friends a
sort of feeling of our situation, and some revival of that zeal
which has been so grievously wanted of late. Against this
there is to be set a very general impression of the badness of
the question, which is certainly in itself not a strong one on our
side, and is made less so in appearance by the necessity we are
under of declining all personal discussions, in order to adhere
to our principle, of the impropriety of such points being debated
in Parliament. I am, however, told that there are a few of
Fox's party who do not like the question, and will not vote
against us. Plumer is mentioned in particular, and there are,
I believe, two or three others. It is a dreadful thing for the
general strength of Government, to have these sort of doubtful
days recurring so often. I am inclined to think that the event
will be that Lord H. will now remain longer than he before
proposed, in order that he may not appear to be driven out by
clamour, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Sir G. Yonge is to have the red riband, which is comical
enough. I will take particular care of what you mention
about Fitzherbert; was he desirous of the riband? if he
was, I should think we might manage it on another opportunity;
though, if I was in his situation, I should certainly
think myself better without it. Trevor is to have the
other, and to go immediately to St. Petersburgh. Lord Harrington
was to have gone there, but thought he could not unless
with the <i>rank</i> of ambassador, which was impossible. Lord<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span>
Dalrymple goes to Turin, and Ewart is to be appointed to Berlin.
Lord Mansfield has resigned. Kenyon is to take his seat the
first day of next Term, but not to be created a peer at present,
in order to break the practice, which was beginning to grow
into a sort of right. I imagine, however, that the state of the
House of Lords will make it necessary to have him there next
year. McDonald is to be Attorney-General; Arden, Master of
the Rolls; Scott, Solicitor; and Bearcroft, Chief Justice of
Chester.</p>

<p>The impeachment is going on so slowly, that I see no prospect
even of the accusation being concluded this year. They
talk of sitting only to the Birthday; and, indeed, after that they
would find it impossible to procure an attendance, either of
Lords or Commons. Our business will certainly be over by
that time. The Budget comes on next Monday, and will be a
glorious one; as not only the current service of the year, but
the extra expenses, both of the Prince of Wales and of the
armament, will be provided for by the exceeding of revenue.</p>

<p>The 'Rusbridge' has brought an account from Madras as late
as the 9th of January. An answer had been received from
Tippoo to Sir A. Campbell's letter. It disclaims all idea of
hostility; and a friendly correspondence had passed between
them since; so that this storm is blown over, at least for the
present; and in the meanwhile we are acquiring more strength
every day. It is impossible to speak in terms of sufficient
admiration of Lord Cornwallis's conduct. I have not yet seen
any finance papers from this last ship; but I make no doubt of
their turning out well, from the general expressions of prosperity,
&amp;c., in his private letters.</p>

<p>I send you over a case given to me by the Duke of Athol,
who has particularly desired my attention to the subject. He
is to bring it forward this year. Can you tell me where I can
find any of my father's papers upon it?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span></p>

<p>I have got the cypher, which answers perfectly. I keep
it, in order to have another made from it. I shall be anxious to
hear of your little girl's doing well.</p>

<p>Ever most affectionately yours,<br/>
W. W. G.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>MR. W. W. GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.</p>

<p>Whitehall, April 30th, 1788.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Brother</span>,</p>

<p>Bastard's motion came on yesterday, and was lost, on the
previous question, by 221 to 169. This division very far
exceeded my expectations, and, indeed, I believe those of most
people, considering the popular nature of the question, and the
many personal considerations which induced people to vote
against us on this point, who do so on no other. It has, I
imagine, entirely put an end to any further discussion of this
subject. It will not diminish your satisfaction on this occasion
to hear that the previous question was moved by me, and that I
had the good fortune not only to satisfy myself, which I have
not done before in the course of this session, but also to satisfy
my friends so well, that the question was rested on my speech,
no other member of Government saying anything.</p>

<p>This event puts an end to all considerations as to any immediate
contingencies to affect our decision of the point which
relates to me. It is therefore not necessary to take any immediate
steps upon it, till we can find some satisfactory solution.
You see that my mind leans at present to taking the Rolls at
the diminished value, but <i>for life</i>; thinking, as I do, more and
more, every day, that such a grant would be perfectly legal and
maintainable against all the world, on the ground of precedent,
of authority, and on the words of the statute itself.</p>

<p>The idea of Lord Clanbrassil's office had occurred to me. I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span>
have no difficulty in stating to you fairly my feelings upon it,
because I know you will enter into them, and judge, after
comparing them with the convenience which you would yourself
derive from such an arrangement, preferably to any
other. Lord Clanbrassil's life I had taken from the Peerage
at fifty-nine, but sixty would not materially alter the calculation.
Such a life, on common averages, is stated in
Price's book as having an expectation of living from fourteen
years to a little less than twelve, according to the healthiness
of the situation. On pursuing his calculations, I am
inclined to believe, that an annuity of &pound;2000 for my life,
to commence after Lord C.'s, would not be materially
different from an annuity in present for my life of &pound;1000.
But these calculations depend on so many nice circumstances,
that, without being more used to them, and acquainted with
the principles they proceed upon, it is not easy to be accurate
in them. Whatever is the result of such a calculation, you
cannot, I am sure, but feel that, at the present period of my
life, and in my circumstances, a certainty of &pound;1000 would be
worth much more to me, in point of happiness, than an expectation
of twice that value at an uncertain period, which though,
on general averages, it might be expected in about thirteen
years, might not fall even in twice that time.</p>

<p>I state this to you, that you may know exactly what I feel
upon the subject; but, at the same time, I know too much
what I owe to you on this, as on every other occasion, not to
be desirous of accommodating my objects to your convenience.
On that ground, therefore, I leave it entirely to you.</p>

<p>I wish you would send me some answer about Sir H.
Hoghton, which I could show him as a point of civility to a
man to whom civility is due from me. I have not done
anything about Sneyd, because, to say the truth, this other
business put it out of my head. I am now unwilling to communicate
your acquiescence to Bagot till I have mentioned it to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span>
you once more. You know the object which I have in it,
and can best judge how far the inconvenience to you is more
than worth while.</p>

<p>I have had Miles with me this morning, to mention that he
had written to you on the subject of a publication respecting
Lord Gormanston's business, but had not received any answer
from you. I told him that I would mention to you what he
had said to me upon it, but that I could not undertake to give
him any answer, as he must receive that from you alone. He
desired me to say that he made the communication as a mark
of respect and attachment. I confess I look upon him as one
of those men with whom connexion or communication, beyond
what may be absolutely necessary, is not desirable; but I may
be mistaken in this; and perhaps that which has already
passed may make it better that you should preserve terms of
civility towards him.</p>

<p>The Duke of Athol's statement of his own case has made
much impression on me: pray tell me what you think of it.
He says he can prove that, although my father passed the Bill
of 1765, from the necessity of applying an immediate remedy
to the mischief of smuggling, yet that it was his intention to
have entered into a fuller investigation of the subject the
following year. He presses me to be one of the Commissioners;
but this I shall probably decline, on the real ground of other
business.</p>

<p>Alexander Hood is to have the red riband, and not Trevor.
He made a very good speech for it last night. There is not the
smallest ground for believing that Sir G. Howard was actuated
by anything else than a sense of the <i>great military character</i>
which he sustains, and perhaps some ground of pique at the
King's having refused to interfere with Mulgrave and myself
to give the Chaplainship of Chelsea to a friend of his. He
asked an audience of the King for the purpose of making this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span>
request, and sent an account of it in a paragraph to the
newspapers.</p>

<p>Ever most affectionately yours,<br/>
W. W. G.</p>

<p>You may, perhaps, have seen in "The World," a most scandalous
misrepresentation of Mornington's conduct the other
evening in the House of Commons. It will, I am sure, give you
pleasure to be assured, that there is not the smallest ground
for so infamous an imputation; and that his conduct on that
occasion is universally felt, and allowed even by those who are
least favourably disposed to him, to have been perfectly correct
and proper. He spoke remarkably well, and said exactly what
his friends could have wished him to say.</p></div>

<p>Mr. Grenville had now made up his mind to take the
reversion of Lord Clanbrassil's office (the Chief Remembrancership),
in preference to the Rolls; for which the Duke
of Leinster, who had given considerable trouble to the
Government in Ireland, was rather a clamorous candidate.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>MR. W. W. GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.</p>

<p>Whitehall, May 12th, 1788.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Brother</span>,</p>

<p>I have just seen Fitzherbert, and have had some conversation
with him about the Mastership of the Rolls. We were
interrupted; but he said enough to convince me, that it is
clearly better that I should take the reversion of Lord Clanbrassil's
office, leaving the Rolls for such present arrangement
as you can make of it. Besides what he mentioned, I have an
additional reason, which I did not state to him; but which had
nearly decided me before I saw him. It is, that I believe the
arrangement which I mentioned to you at Stowe, and which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span>
you so clearly thought the most desirable that could occur for
me, is now so nearly settled, that it is very unlikely that anything
should prevent its taking place before the prorogation of
Parliament, which must be in about three weeks, or a month, at
furthest. I think you will clearly understand what I mean,
when I refer to our conversation in the flower-garden at Stowe,
and to the particular sense which I have always entertained of
your kindness on that occasion. Fitzherbert, however, tells
me, that he sends off the messenger on Thursday, when I will
write to you more explicitly on this subject, and on the other
arrangements connected with it, which, however, are still in
great measure undecided; but the thing itself I now consider
as almost certain. It would be an unpardonable affectation in
me, especially when writing to you, to whom I have been
accustomed to think aloud, if I were to attempt to disguise
from you, that the prospect is, in the highest degree, pleasing
to me, as holding out to me a situation, though far above my
pretensions, yet so circumstanced as to give me hopes of filling
it without discredit. I know how much you will share my
satisfaction, and have, therefore, no difficulty in expressing it to
you. It is not a little heightened, by comparing it with what I
mentioned to you as having been since proposed to me, and
what I was so near being compelled to accept. There is,
however, still one contingency, which may prevent this from
taking place: I think it not a probable one. I am obliged
to write a little in the Sphinx style, but on Thursday I will speak
more openly. I could not, however, resist the desire of taking
the first moment to tell you, generally, the situation of this
business.</p>

<p>We had the account yesterday of the <i>lit de justice</i>, which
was held at Versailles the day after the King had besieged
his Parliament at Paris. He has taken from all the different
Parliaments throughout the kingdom the power and function
of registering edicts, and has created, or (as the "Arr&ecirc;t" says)<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span>
<i>renewed</i> a <i>Cour pl&eacute;ni&egrave;re</i> for that purpose. This <i>Cour pl&eacute;ni&egrave;re</i>
is to consist of the <i>grande chambre</i> of the Parliament of Paris,
with the addition of the Princes and Peers, of one member to
be named from each of the other Parliaments, and of the
person filling great offices (Charges de la Couronne). These
will make, in all, about one hundred and eight persons, if the
calculation, I saw, is right. They are all to be named by the
King; but all to hold their situations for life. All edicts are
to be registered by them for the whole kingdom. This expedient
may give a present relief; but it seems a most dangerous
experiment to concentre so much power of resistance in one
body of men appointed for life.</p>

<p>There had been no tumult whatever at Paris on this occasion.
Some difficulty was expected in the provinces, particularly at
Rouen and Rennes; but nothing was known of what had passed
there. I do not recollect that I have any other news for you.</p>

<p>Ever most affectionately yours,<br/>
W. W. G.</p></div>

<p>The next letter touches upon the reversion, and enters
into a detail of the contemplated changes in the Administration
consequent upon the retirement of Lord Howe.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>MR. W. W. GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.</p>

<p>Whitehall, May 16th, 1788.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Brother</span>,</p>

<p>I mentioned to you in my last letter, that Fitzherbert's conversation
had decided me in thinking it better for me to take
the reversion of Lord Clanbrassil's office (supposing it clearly
grantable in reversion), rather than the Mastership of the Rolls.
One reason which weighed with me, was the knowledge of the
arrangement which is to take place the first week in June, and
which I can now explain to you more particularly. The first<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span>
move is that of the Admiralty, from which Lord Howe retires,
agreeably to his former intimation. From what I understand
from Pitt, I doubt very much whether it would have been
possible to have prevailed upon him to alter his resolution;
but, on the whole, I think it infinitely better, considering his
great unpopularity both in the Navy and in the House of
Commons, that he should withdraw himself. The last division,
and the question having in consequence of it been entirely
dropped, are circumstances which I think are sufficient to show
that he has not been driven out; and by his retiring, we shall
avoid many other discussions, which would, I am persuaded,
have been brought forward. Pitt's intention is to place his
brother at the head of that department, giving him Sir Charles
Middleton and Hood for assistants; and prevailing with Mulgrave,
if possible, to accept the Comptrollership of the Navy.
I have no doubt of this arrangement being, in general, very
acceptable; the great popularity of Lord Chatham's manners,
added to that of his name, and his near connection with Pitt,
are, I think, sufficient to remove the impression of any objection
in the public opinion, from his being brought forward in the
first instance in so responsible a situation. To those who know
him, there can be no doubt that his abilities are fully equal to
the undertaking, arduous as it is; and to those who do not,
Sir Charles Middleton's name and character will hold out a
solution. On the whole, I am persuaded that this arrangement
will not only be the best that could be made under the present
circumstances, but that it will be a source of real and solid
strength to Pitt's Government, by bringing Lord Chatham
forward, and by connecting the department of the Admiralty
with the rest of the Administration, which has never yet been
the case under Pitt's Government, even in the smallest degree.
The opening which Mulgrave makes, enables Pitt to make Lord
Sydney sole Paymaster, and to give me the Seals of the Home<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span>
Department. He has shown much anxiety to bring this part
of the arrangement to bear; and I sometimes flatter myself,
that in this part also of his Government he will be considerably
stronger than before.</p>

<p>I have obtained his permission to communicate to you the
whole of this plan immediately after its formation. I think its
execution probable, though not certain. It has as yet not been
communicated even to many of the parties concerned. He is to
begin by his brother, whom he sees to-day, in order to obtain
his final consent, which, from previous conversations, he has no
reason to doubt of. The other persons are to be talked to one
by one, and the whole to be done and declared the day before
the prorogation, in order that my writ may be moved. He
thinks Sir C. M.'s consent quite certain, and Mulgrave's
highly probable; but that part in which I am concerned
does not depend on that, as, even if Mulgrave refuses the
Comptrollership, there is another arrangement, though not one
equally desirable, by which he will vacate the Pay-Office. The
only impediment that can be thrown in my way is from the
Duke of Richmond, who has, certainly, if he is disposed to
push it, a prior claim to Lord Sydney's office; but there is
the greatest reason to believe, that he will prefer to remain
where he now is. This will, however, be ascertained in a few
days, when I write to you again. I think, if all this takes
place, it will be a pretty decisive answer to all the ideas that
have been thrown out of the King's wavering; and in that
point of view, independent of all others, it is extremely desirable.
Under these circumstances, I have no doubt that you
will think that I have done right in eagerly embracing the offer
which has been made me; and, also, that you will be of opinion
that the reversion is much preferable to the office in Ireland,
which would, just at this moment, expose me to much unnecessary
odium, besides the great inconvenience of a journey to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span>
Ireland, in a situation which requires constant residence and
attendance.</p>

<p>Ever most affectionately yours,<br/>
W. W. G.</p></div>

<p>A letter from Sir William Young, of the same date,
elucidates the imbroglio still farther, and is especially
interesting as an illustration of that peculiar trait in His
Majesty's character&mdash;his intimate knowledge and curiosity
about persons&mdash;to which attention has already been drawn.
The whole description of the interview with the King is
a good specimen of familiar historical painting.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>SIR WILLIAM YOUNG TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.</p>

<p>Old Bond Street, May 16th, 1788.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Lord</span>,</p>

<p>His Majesty honoured me, on Wednesday, with a pretty
long conference in the closet; during which we travelled over
the whole <i>carte du pays Hibernois</i>. He was, as usual, much
more particular in his inquiries about <i>persons</i> than about
<i>business</i>; and he seemed to be, above all, very anxious to learn
how we stood with Lord Shannon, having learnt from Mr. O.
that his Lordship was to be at dagger-drawing with us, on
account of his supposed resentment for your Lordship's supposed
ill-treatment of Mr. Adderley. I acquainted His Majesty
with the true state of that matter, with Lord Shannon's very
handsome language respecting it, and his friendly and becoming
conduct ever since; with which information the King
appeared to be highly pleased, and he was even proceeding
to animadvert pretty severely upon Mr. O. for having, as he
thought, attempted, though ineffectually, to convert this transaction<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span>
into a source of mutual coldness and mistrust between
your Lordship and Lord Shannon; but I thought it right to
disculpate my predecessor from this charge, of which I really
believe him to be innocent.</p>

<p>The Duke of Leinster's name too was more than once upon
the <i>tapis</i>, and I detailed to His Majesty the whole history of
his Grace's political conduct and professions, from his first
interview with your Lordship down to the letter he received
from you, in answer to his application for the Mastership of the
Rolls; but I said nothing of your future views with regard to
that office, neither did His Majesty manifest any desire to be
informed of them. In general, he seemed to me to be perfectly
<i>au fait</i> of the Duke's real character, as well as of the
character of all the other leading people in Ireland, whom we
talked over, each in his turn, not forgetting our friend, the
Archbishop of Cashel.</p>

<p>On points of business, as I have said, His Majesty was
much more concise, and I do not recollect anything material
or interesting that fell from him, unless it be that he expressed
the most entire satisfaction in the planning and in
the execution of our new military arrangement. I, of course,
did not omit to take this opportunity of offering your Lordship's
humble duty to him, together with every suitable assurance
of your zeal, &amp;c., for his service; in answer to which he
said many very gracious things, and proceeded to question me
very closely and <i>very minutely</i> about your and Lady B.'s health,
amusements, house, &amp;c.; upon all which points I took care
to be very precise and guarded in my answers, having reason
to believe that, from the lively interest he takes in your
domestic happiness, they will make a deeper impression upon
his memory than any other part of our conversation.</p>

<p>Mr. Grenville tells me that he has written to your Lordship
to say that he has finally made up his mind to the acceptance
of Lord Clanbrassil's <i>survivance</i>, in lieu of the Mastership<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span>
of the Rolls; so I conclude that you will by this time have
begun your negotiation with the Duke of Leinster, the result of
which I am impatient to learn.</p>

<p>I have not yet been able to see either Mr. Pitt or Lord
Sydney, but I learnt this morning at the latter's office that
the King had consented that Major Coote should have the
lieutenant-colonelcy of the 70th; and the notification of the
appointment will, I believe, be sent to your Lordship by tomorrow's
post.</p>

<p>The papers will have informed you, my Lord, of the events
of France since my last, and particularly that the Grand
Chamber of the Parliament of Paris has refused to become a
constituent part of the new Plenary Court; so that some new
expedient must in all probability be adopted. The Duke of
Dorset writes word that the Parisian public still remain very
quiet spectators of these disputes, but it seems that in Brittany
they are apprehensive of some very serious troubles, and accordingly
a strong reinforcement of troops has been sent to the
Commandant of that province, M. de Thiard.</p>

<p>In Holland, the patriotic party, though still sullen and
stubborn, seem to have lost all present hope of reinstating
themselves in favour; so the Prince of Orange is now King of
the Republic, with Sir T. H., Viceroy, over him. The latter
will, I believe, be created a Peer in a few days.</p>

<p>The ferment in the city still continues on account of the
failure of the cotton-traders, many of whom are, it seems,
so deeply involved, that it will be absolutely impossible to
devise any artificial mode of bolstering up their credit; and it
is to be feared that their failure will occasion very great distress
amongst the merchantmen.</p>

<p>I send you, my Lord, two pamphlets upon the subject of
this trade, which you will find to contain some very curious
and important facts, though perhaps you will not agree with
the author in the conclusions he draws from them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span></p>

<p>Adieu, my dear Lord. May I entreat you to present my
best respects and remembrances to Lady Buckingham. I have
seen Lady Carysfort, who is very well, as is also her child,
which is the very image in miniature of your Lady Mary.</p></div>

<p>Another letter of gossip from the same correspondent.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>SIR WILLIAM YOUNG TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.</p>

<p>Stratton Street, June 7th, 1788.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Lord</span></p>

<p>No intelligence having arrived from St. Vincent's since my
last letter, my mind is most restless, and so occupied with the
contingencies which another letter may clear up, and decide,
either that I am to see my father this summer, or to see him no
more, that I am unfit almost for any employment but that of
walking to the Royal Exchange and back again, on inquiry after
a ship. It is most necessary, however, to the health of mind, to
avert it occasionally from such a subject, so doubtful and so
covered with gloom; and I cannot better do it than by writing
to your Lordship, thus engaging at once my attention under the
impulses of sincerest friendship, and grateful sense of duty.
Of events in the political circle, to the intelligence of the
newspapers of this day, I will add the death of Ashley Cooper,
and the succession of Mr. Rose to the office of Clerk of the
Parliaments. I understand he will resume, notwithstanding his
seat in the Commons, and continue Secretary of the Treasury.
It is expected that on Monday will be moved the new writs for
Sir L. Kenyon, Chief Justice; Arden, Master of the Rolls;
Macdonald and Scott, Attorney and Solicitor-General; and
Rose, Clerk of the Parliaments. The marriage of Fox and
Miss Pultency is something more than common talk; at the Duke
of York's ball he sat three hours in a corner with her; attends
her weekly to Ranelagh, and is a perfect Philander. The Duke<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</a></span>
of York lives almost with Lady Tyrconnel, and there has been
some <i>fracas</i> on Mrs. Fitzherbert declining Lady Tyrconnel's
visits, as a lady whose character is contaminate! These, with
the suicide of George Hesse, form the leading topics of the
<i>beau monde</i>. Of our political career, I can only say that I
made a good guess when I stated the 20th of June as the close
of our sessions; the intermediate time has little business
pending that will engage debate, excepting the reform of the
Scotch boroughs, on which the alternative for or against is
equally a Scotch job. Sheridan takes the lead in it, and comes
plumed with his laurels gathered in Westminster Hall. His
speech there contained some wonderful stroke in the declamatory
style, something fanciful, poetical, and even sublime; sometimes,
however, bombast, and the logic not satisfactory, at least to my
mind. The performance, however, was a work of great industry,
and great genius; and he has had compliments enough on it to
turn his head, if to those qualities he does not add great <i>good
sense</i>; a quality which, the longer I live, the more I am persuaded
is the true <i>rara avis</i>, and not much oftener met

<p>By this post I enclose two copies of the enlarged edition of
my pamphlet, with the Poor Bill annexed. It will be carried,
if I can depend on present assurances of support; not merely
assurances of individual members, but on the actual letters of
instruction which several have had from the justices of their
respective counties. Adverting to justices, it is agreed in Bucks
to respite all appeals and other matters, with exception of gaol
delivery, to the Michaelmas Sessions, on account of the interference
of the circuit. Poor Major Tomkins so informed me
yesterday. We walked together the best part of the morning,
and he seemed restored to a greater degree of tranquillity of
mind than might so early have been expected. He talks of
quitting Weston, and living wholly in London; and wishes to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</a></span>
engage his mind by attention to the law professionally. At his
time of life, this may answer (if he can now apply) in giving the
relief to a mind disquiet in idleness, but hardly can answer in
views of business, under technical acceptation of the term. He
has, however, such delusion, and it must be an enemy to his
repose who undeceives him. My wife desires to be remembered
in the best manner to the Marchioness and Mrs. Nugent, with,</p>

<p>Mr. Hastings' trial was at its height at this time; and
Mr. Bernard, Lord Buckingham's secretary, gives a brief
account of Sheridan's third day. The point, naturally
enough, which made the deepest impression on him was
the exhibition in evidence of the private letters that passed
between Mr. Hastings and his secretary.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>MR. BERNARD TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.</p>

<p>Bolton Street, June 10th, 1788.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My Lord</span>,</p>

<p>I have been this morning at the trial: it was Sheridan's third
day. It was near one o'clock before he began. There was
nothing very striking or brilliant in his oratory: he continued
for about an hour and a quarter, and then retired. Mr. Adam
assisted him in the reading parts; and continued reading after
he retired. Presently he made a lame apology for him, saying
that he had a very trifling &mdash;&mdash; without specifying what, whether
illness, agitation, or want of due preparation. Mr. Fox soon
afterwards made a more complete apology for him, and the Court
adjourned; but till what time I have not heard.</p>

<p>I was gratified with the sight as an object of curiosity, but not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</a></span>
as affording either pleasure or entertainment. It would seem
preposterous to me, if upon any charge against the Government
of Ireland, the Lord-Lieutenant's, or his secretary's <i>private</i> and
<i>separate</i> letters were to be subjected in a Court of Justice to all
the acrimonious, malevolent and palpably strained comments
that forty of the ablest men of an opposite party could put upon
them, particularly without having an equal number of persons of
a similar description in point of talents and political weight to
defend them. And yet this seems to be the case in the instance
of the present tribunal; for the letters read and commented
upon to-day, were chiefly of the above description: the letters
absolutely official were very little dwelt upon.</p>

<p>Your Excellency's most faithful and affectionate servant,<br/>
<span class="smcap">S. Bernard</span>.</p></div>

<p>Lord Bulkeley, whose talents in the way of pleasant
gossip appear to such advantage in this correspondence,
regards the trial as a nine hours' wonder. We get the
true colour of contemporary opinion out of communications
of this intimate and easy class.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>LORD BULKELEY TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.</p>

<p>Stanhope Street, June 14th, 1788.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dearest Lord</span>,</p>

<p>We have been exceedingly alarmed here, with a report of
Lord Temple's dangerous illness. I called at your brother
W. Grenville's to know the particulars, but did not find him.
I then learnt from Fitzherbert that the crisis was happily
passed, and that you and Lady Buckingham were released from
the melancholy alarms which you both had on so dreadful a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</a></span>
visitation of Providence. I hope this letter will find you all as
well as you can wish or expect. I do not know how far employment
and a great situation compensate to you for other
<i>d&eacute;sagr&eacute;mens</i>; but you seem to me to have sacrificed more than
most men in devoting yourself to your present office, and in
quitting your comforts in this country. There is no accounting
for taste, and that being yours, I cannot help remarking,
with much concern, how heavily you have been visited in your
domestic enjoyments, by the illness of Lady B. and yourself,
and your boy, and by the death of the unfortunate T&mdash;&mdash;ns.</p>

<p>One is apt to imagine that the air of Pall Mall, Paddington
and Stowe, would have kept away such heavy misfortunes, and
that you would have been easier and happier than you are now.
I sometimes think, that idle men with good fortunes are happier
than busy men; their enjoyments perhaps are not so
acute, but their cares are fewer.</p>

<p>Poor Parry is retired <i>dans ses terres</i>, with a fret on his mind
which will probably soon carry him to the churchyard; this
has been much increased by a discovery that the Chancellor
objected to his competency, at least Pitt says so, and the other
does not deny it: between them all he has certainly been very
ill-used, and has been led on to expect what was never meant
to be given him.</p>

<p>I shall be much obliged to you for the copy of my letter to
Pitt, which I enclosed to you in my last letter, as it is the only
one I have. It has never been answered, nor has Pitt ever said
a word to me on the subject, which I think unhandsome and
unkind. He must be the best judge, whether such personal
inattentions can ensure the continuance of zeal and activity in
his interests of those who plague themselves with counties and
boroughs.</p>

<p>I was told yesterday by Lord Lovaine, that the Duke of
Northumberland had refused to bring Rose again into Parliament,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span>
which shows a coolness between him and Pitt; but I
dare say it will not break out into anything like opposition,
though a strong report prevails that he has joined Lord
Rawdon's armed neutrality.</p>

<p>Sheridan finished his summing-up yesterday on the Begum
charge, and has certainly throughout displayed the greatest
and most artful abilities. The Opposition are very anxious to
work it up into a flame against Government; but I cannot say
at present, that I see anything more in the public than a
nine hours' wonder, and an anxiety for fashion's sake to get
tickets for wives and daughters. What may be the future
impression of the public is impossible to say, but it seems to
have been an unwise measure originally in Pitt to give such a
handle to such able men as those who conduct the prosecution
against Hastings; indeed, he seems so sensible of it himself,
that he has suffered Sir E. Impey to escape impeachment, and
has protected him against it, which I do not know is not a
stronger measure than the other would have been.</p>

<p>I shall remain here till the 24th, when I am to receive
&pound;2000 from Mr. Campbell; and then, with my debts paid,
I shall take Sir George Warren's, in Cheshire, in my way to
Wales, whence, if I can get leave of absence, I shall certainly
come over to you for a short time; the Viscountess being inexorable
on the bare mention of Dublin, and we all know she is
a steady one in her resolutions.</p>

<p>The Fortescues are by this time perched at Castlehill, and
he has mounted a cockade in his title to it, of which he is
very proud and happy. He is so much liked and esteemed,
and so deservedly, that no appointment ever gave more universal
satisfaction.</p>

<p>The Nevilles are at Stanlake, and we were invited there next
Monday; but they have put us off till the end of the week, so
we shall put them off till another opportunity, as I must be in
town on the 24th.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</a></span></p>

<p>Sir William and Lady Williams are preparing for a tour to
Switzerland, with your brother Tom; but I should not be
surprised, if the scheme, from some cause or other, would fall
to the ground, and end in Brighthelmstone, or some sea-bathing
place.</p>

<p>I saw your brother Marquis the day before yesterday, who
told me, that he heard, with the <i>greatest concern</i>, that your
popularity in Ireland was falling apace, and that the candles
were out; and concluded by asking me whether I had heard of
it, which I assured him I had not. He followed this up by
several eulogies on the comforts of Bowood, and of his domestic
life. Hah! hah! hah!</p>

<p>Robert Williams has attended his guard duty very regularly,
and General Hyde is very well pleased with him; he goes the
24th, for a month, with a detachment to Hampton Court for a
month. Lady B. and he beg their love and respects to Lady
Buckingham and yourself.</p>

<p>Pray give me two lines, and believe me ever affectionately
your friend and servant,</p>

<p>B.</p></div>

<p>The first intimation of a break in the King's health
appears in June, soon after the birthday. "The King,"
writes Mr. Grenville, "has been a good deal out of order,
but is recovered." The heavy calamity impending over
the country, the seeds of which were already sown, was
little suspected at that moment.</p>

<p>The meditated arrangements in the Administration came
to nothing. Personal obstacles first interrupted, and finally
frustrated them altogether. As usual, whenever a difficulty
sprang up, Thurlow was found the most impracticable
man in the Cabinet.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>MR. W. W. GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.</p>

<p>Whitehall, June 23rd, 1788.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Brother</span>,</p>

<p>I mentioned to you in my other letter of this date, that it
appeared to me most probable that the arrangement by which I
was to succeed to Lord Sydney's office will not take place till
some new opening is made. The fact is, that the plan, as it
was originally formed, depended on Lord Mulgrave's taking
Sir Charles Middleton's office, and thereby opening the whole
Pay-Office for Lord Sydney. But this has been found impracticable,
both from the difficulty of placing Sir C. Middleton
at the Admiralty, and from the great improbability that
Mulgrave could be induced in his present frame of mind to
undertake the Comptrollership. It has, therefore, been
determined that Lord Chatham should take the Admiralty for
the present, with no other alteration in the Board except
substituting Lord Hood instead of Brett. Leveson Gower and
Middleton are on such bad terms, that it would have been
impossible for them to have acted at the same Board; and
considering Gower's conduct, his professional character, and
his connections, it seemed equally impossible to drive him
from it.</p>

<p>This being the case, there will no longer be any opening by
which Lord Sydney could have an adequate provision made for
him in case of his retiring. You know that I was never desirous,
nor indeed should I choose, to press his being removed to make
room for me unless it could be done in a manner perfectly
satisfactory to himself, or at least satisfactory to Pitt's mind;
and, even as things now stand, it seems impossible but that
some such occasion must soon occur. Any vacancy of a sinecure
office in England would immediately hold out a retreat for him;
any such vacancy in Scotland might be given to Dundas, who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</a></span>
would then vacate the Treasurership of the Navy; and any
vacancy of one of the ordinary offices of Government might be
given to Mulgrave, which would open the Pay-Office. I know
that this arrangement would be considered by Pitt as the first
object in the disposal of anything that may fall, and I think,
therefore, that I am not very sanguine in believing that it is
not postponed to any very distant period. Lord Marchmont,
Stuart, McKenzie, and Barr&eacute;, have all them been thought likely
to make openings since this business has been in agitation, and
there are a variety of other accidents that would answer the
same purpose. The enumerating all these chances bears the
appearance of more impatience on my part than I really feel,
but I do it to satisfy that which I know you will feel on finding
that the object is postponed after we thought it so nearly
accomplished. For my own part, I repeat what I told you in
a former letter, that the circumstances of my present situation,
in almost every point of view, and particularly the confidence
with which I am treated, leave me very little to look to, or to
hope for, from any change that can arise; and for this reason,
as long as I keep my rank and pretensions, and do not see
others advanced before me, I am by no means anxious for
pressing forward the proposed arrangement.</p>

<p>I have tired you long enough about myself, which I should not
have done if I was writing to one less interested in that subject
than I know you are. There are a few other things which I am
glad to take this opportunity of mentioning to you. I do not
know whether you will have heard anything of the strange conduct
of the Chancellor. When the Rolls were vacated by Sir Thomas
Sewell's death, the office lay between Kenyon and Eyre. The
Chancellor felt that he could not avoid offering it to Kenyon,
but was at the same time very desirous that he should decline
it, in order that Eyre might be appointed. Pitt was, on the
other hand, eager that he should take it, in order that Arden
might have the Chief-Justiceship of Chester, and he succeeded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</a></span>
in persuading Kenyon to accept. From that time, the Chancellor
conceived a pique against Arden; and although there is no
competition against him, either from Eyre, who is in a better
situation, or from any other person that the Chancellor cares for,
yet Thurlow has thrown every difficulty in the way of his
appointment. Within this last ten days he has refused to take
the necessary steps for giving it effect, and has held language
which amounted almost to an intention of resigning rather than
putting the Seal to Arden's patent. This conduct was the
more intolerable, because some months ago, when Lord
Mansfield's resignation was in question, he had expressly told
Pitt that he felt that Arden must have the Rolls, and that
though he disliked the appointment, he would not throw any
obstacles in its way. I much doubt whether it has originated
in any settled disgust, or desire of picking a quarrel, but rather
attribute it to the strange temper of his mind, soured at this
particular time by the plague of the trial, and by actual illness.
It has, however, made it necessary for Pitt to come to an
explanation with him, which, though not fully satisfactory to my
feelings, has, however, removed any further obstacles to the
particular point in question; which had indeed gone so far as to
make it utterly impossible for Pitt to recede, whatever had been
the consequences. I have given you this story at full length,
because I thought you would certainly hear something of it
from report, and that you would be desirous of knowing the
real particulars of it.</p>

<p>Our cousin of Northumberland, has, I think, decidedly joined
the independent party under the auspices of Lord Rawdon and
Bastard, and in consequence of this has refused to re-elect
Rose. You see this is a pretty strong declaration of hostilities,
considering all the circumstances of Rose's situation in Government,
and of his connection with the Duke himself before he
became so great a man. It is peculiarly unhandsome after
what has passed about the Riband, which, though it could not be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</a></span>
given to him, was kept vacant till another fell. The immediate
loss to us is very small in point of numbers, as the greatest
part of his votes are already in opposition; and considering his
character, it is perfectly plain that there was little chance of his
giving any substantial assistance at a general election. I only
lament, therefore, that he has got his Riband; and for the rest,
"I trust we have about the Court, a thousand's good as he."
And if we had not, we might have them, for offers of negotiation
are coming in from all quarters. I believe Lord Beauchamp
will be closed with, being only for a Marquisate for Lord
Hertford, and the sole question now being the time of doing
it. Upon the whole, I am far from thinking that we end the
session at all weaker than we began it, notwithstanding some
untoward circumstances which occurred. Our foreign politics
are going on, in my apprehension, as successfully as possible.
The French were beginning to cabal against us at Berlin, but
the signature of the Treaty has completely overthrown them
there. They were at the same time giving themselves some
airs of importance at the Hague. They presented a memorial,
complaining in strong terms of the 6th Article of our Treaty,
which is unquestionably as offensive to them as it could be.
This has not yet been answered, but it will be, and in terms
at least as strong as those in which it is couched. Their
Ambassador, M. de St. Priest, appears to have had orders to
behave in the most offensive manner possible. By great good
luck in the first squabble that has occurred in consequence of
this, between one of his servants and the mob of the Hague,
his man has put himself completely in the wrong; so that
when he presented a memorial complaining of the insult offered
to a person in his service, he received for answer a letter
enclosing copies of the examinations taken before the Court of
Justice, and trusting that as those papers evidently proved the
violation of their territory by a person in his service, he would
not fail to support the complaint which the States-General <i>had</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</a></span>
<i>already</i> directed their Minister at Paris to make on this subject.
I mention all this, not so much for the importance of the thing
itself, which will end in a paper war, as for the sake of showing
you how much the temper of our friends must be altered, from
the time when no persuasion of ours could induce them to act
with the smallest degree of vigour or firmness.</p>

<p>I have not seen any account from France since I last wrote to
you, but there is a report that Calonne has had an account of
further violences at Grenoble. There is no further news of the
Imperialists. Fitzherbert seems to expect more from the Russians
than I see any reason for. He is, however, unquestionably much
better informed on that subject than I can pretend to be. I confess
I am very curious to see the effect that will be produced by the
Prussian alliance on the minds of the other European powers,
but particularly of the French. In the present moment there
seems great reason to believe that the two Imperial Courts and
France, are each of them dissatisfied with the other two. To
a certain degree, it will have a tendency to reunite them; but
there are so many causes of jealousy, that I think one need not
be very sanguine to disbelieve the probability of any permanent
good understanding being established between them.</p>

<p>Nothing could be handsomer than the manner in which the
King acceded to the proposal which Pitt made him, of bringing
Lord Chatham and myself forward in the manner then intended.
He has since spoken to me on the subject in the most flattering
terms, and has shown an eagerness to facilitate the arrangement
by proposing expedients for removing the only difficulty
which delays it.</p>

<p>Adieu, my dear brother.</p>

<p>Believe me ever most affectionately yours,<br/>
W. W. G.</p></div>

<p>The King's personal interference in appointments and
promotions had produced, on several occasions, remonstrances<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</a></span>
and complaints from Lord Buckingham, and the
judicious zeal of Mr. Grenville was in constant requisition
to prevent an open rupture between the Lord-Lieutenant
and the Government. Calm and enduring as he was,
Mr. Grenville frankly stated to his brother that, although
he could never tire of the employment of serving him,
his patience was almost exhausted by finding that one
case was no sooner settled or compromised (for it generally
ended in that way) than a fresh one came upon the
<i>tapis</i>. At length, the tenacity of the King on these
points wounded Lord Buckingham so keenly, that it
very nearly led to the most serious consequences. Lord
Buckingham wished to appoint his nephew, Colonel Nugent,
to a vacant lieutenant-colonelcy within his own patronage,
and through some friendly channel notified or expressed
his desire to do so; but the King, without communicating
his intentions, or waiting to go through the ordinary
official forms, which usually founded such appointments
on the recommendation of the Lord-Lieutenant, appointed
another person to the vacancy&mdash;Colonel Gwynne.</p>

<p>Lord Buckingham felt the slight so acutely, that he
threatened to resign; and was probably dissuaded from
that step by the counsels of Mr. Grenville, whose wise
and temperate letter on the occasion will be read with
admiration. Mr. Pitt also interposed, offering to appease
Lord Buckingham's feelings by any course of proceeding
which, under the circumstances, could be resorted to for
the purpose of relieving the transaction of the appearance
of a personal or official indignity. The grounds upon which
the royal excuse rested were, that Lord Buckingham's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</a></span>
wishes were not known to his Majesty, and that military
appointments were not expressly included in the Viceroy's
patronage.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>MR. W. W. GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.</p>

<p>Whitehall, July 1st, 1788.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Brother,</span></p>

<p>I received yesterday morning your two letters of the 25th
and 27th, and was preparing to answer them to-day, when I
received a third letter from you with its enclosures. Nothing
could exceed my surprise at reading Lord Sydney's letters.
The only reason of their having been delayed till the 23rd was,
that, at my request, Pitt had desired Lord Sydney not to write
to you till he could see him, in order more certainly to secure&mdash;what
I had understood to have been before settled with
him&mdash;that the thing should <i>not</i> be done in the form in which
it has been done. I had never imagined that the thing itself
could be pleasing to you, although I certainly entertained no
apprehensions of your thinking of quitting your situation,
because in a single instance the King's private wishes had
interfered with your patronage. I had, on the contrary, supposed
that if it was done in such a manner as to mark,
unequivocally, that it was a personal interference of the King's
in behalf of his own aid-de-camp and equerry, and that it
was not a competition for patronage on the part of any other
person, you would think it right to do what is done in every
other department of Government&mdash;to acquiesce in it as a thing
out of the ordinary course, and as a gratification of the King's
personal wishes. It was under these impressions, that when
I was informed of the circumstance by Fitzherbert, on the
Saturday morning, I thought it infinitely more desirable for
you that I should confine myself to securing that the attention
due to you should be preserved in the mode of doing it, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</a></span>
that it should be stated to you in a private letter, and afterwards
be carried into effect upon your recommendation, than
that I should endeavour to take any steps for inducing the
King to withdraw his interference in favour of a man for
whom he felt personally interested, and whom he had acquainted
with his intentions in his favour. It was very
doubtful whether any endeavours of this sort, from whatever
quarter they came, could be successful after he was so far
engaged; and he could not fail to consider the attempt in the
most ungracious light, both with respect to you and to every
other person engaged in it. Add to this, that I did not then
know that you had any object in it, beyond the common course
of army patronage. With respect to what you mention of the
aggravation arising from the preference given in this instance
over your own nephew, and of its being publicly known in
Dublin that Colonel Nugent's name, and your wishes in his
behalf, had been previously stated to the King, I can positively
assure you that neither Pitt nor myself, nor even Fitzherbert,
as he has expressly told me, had any knowledge of your intention
to recommend Colonel Nugent till several days after this
transaction passed. Under these circumstances, I cannot still
help thinking that I acted right in not taking such steps as
must involve you, whether you wished or not, in a personal
contest of this nature with the King.</p>

<p>In the point which I did labour, I have failed; but from
what reason, or from what fatality, I am utterly at a loss to
conceive. It is certainly true that, both in the commission
and in the instructions to the Lord-Lieutenant, all military
promotions are expressly reserved to the King, and that they
do not fall in the line either of those offices which the Lord-Lieutenant
himself disposes of, or of those on which the
King declares his intention of waiting for the Lord-Lieutenant's
recommendation. But the practice and the understanding
certainly is, and it is so recognised in Lord Sydney's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</a></span>
letter, that the Lord-Lieutenant should recommend to all
commissions below the rank of Colonel. It is on this ground
that I thought, and continue to think, that the King's <i>wishes</i>
only ought to have been intimated to you, and that your
recommendation ought to have preceded the appointment.
I understood Fitzherbert, at the time, that he had been assured
by Lord Sydney that the thing should be done in this mode.
To make this more secure Pitt, undertook, as I have before
mentioned, to see him before he wrote to you, and as that was
impossible before the Monday, he begged him to delay his
letter till then. We none of us conceived that the delay of
these two days would have afforded you any additional uneasiness,
as the whole circumstance would, in the interim, have
been stated to you, and explained by Fitzherbert and myself.
When I saw Pitt afterwards, he assured me that the thing
would be done as I wished it. How it has happened, after
this, that you have received the notification exactly in that
form which both Pitt and myself laboured so much to prevent,
is to me utterly inexplicable. I know that what I am going to
say will seem to you extraordinary, and yet I must say it,
because it is the real truth: I am still in the entire, firm, and
thorough persuasion that there is not in Lord Sydney the
remotest wish (as there cannot be the shadow of an interest)
to do anything that can be personally offensive, or even disagreeable
to you. Pitt, on whose sincerity I have ever found
reason to rely, has assured me that he is in the same belief,
and Fitzherbert entirely agrees with me. I am to see Pitt
again in the course of to-day; but I am not sure whether it
will be time enough for this letter. He will have endeavoured
to inform himself upon the subject, and to see whether any
and what solution can be found for the difficulties which you
feel with respect to it. You will, I am sure, feel&mdash;and, indeed,
your last letter seems to express it&mdash;that after what has passed
it is impossible to induce the King to withdraw Colonel<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</a></span>
Gwynne, as that would be a disgrace to which nothing could
make him submit, short of a necessity more absolute than he
could see in this case. Whatever else can be done you will, I
am sure, find Pitt ready and desirous to do. I showed him
your letter, which I received to-day; but I had not communicated
to him your two former letters, because he is spoken of
there in terms very different from what his conduct in this
business has merited. Your letter to him was written in a
strain of more justice; but it is surely early in this business
for you to complain of having been abandoned.</p>

<p>I shall write to you again to-morrow, and it is not impossible
that you may receive that letter even before this, as I think I
shall avail myself of Bernard's offer to be the carrier of it. I
have written this in the same free and unreserved manner in
which I am happy to think our correspondence has ever been
carried on; I am not, however, without uneasiness as to the
impression which it may make on your mind. I feel the
peculiarity of my situation, and the possibility of your thinking
that I am biassed by my own personal objects, to lay less stress
upon points affecting your honour than I should otherwise do.
I have, however, relied on your entertaining a more favourable
opinion of me. If I do not grossly flatter myself, I am capable
of forming an opinion unbiassed by the considerations to which
I allude; especially on points where my own honour, or that
which I value as dearly as my own, is concerned. I have
examined my own heart, and can say, with confidence, that it is
not from personal motives that I speak, when I say that you
lay upon these points a degree of weight far beyond what they
deserve. If you were in a situation of inferiority or dependance,
a watchful attention to everything of this sort would be necessary,
and therefore commendable; because, without that, you
could not preserve the degree of respect and consideration which
is essential to carrying on the duties of your office. In your
actual situation, it is surely not doing justice to yourself to talk<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</a></span>
of being disgraced by such circumstances as these, or to imagine
that your consequence can be lessened or impaired by them.
With respect to the thing itself, I believe that it never happened
to the most absolute Minister that ever governed this country to
feel it in his power to exclude all personal interference from the
Crown in the nomination to offices. I am sure it is not a matter
of policy to any Minister to wish it; and a very little reflection
will convince you that such at least is not the system of the present
Government, or of the present times. How, then, are you disgraced,
because a single instance of this nature occurs within what
are understood to be the limits of your patronage? But you will
say this may be repeated, and I shall lose the means of carrying
on the Government. My answer is, that you will act in Ireland
as you would act here in any of the situations of this Government;
that the line is perfectly easy to be defined to every
man's understanding, though not reduced to a written rule,
and the limits easily seen, where the King's recommendations
cease to be the casual exertions of private favour, and begin to
be systematic interferences with the power entrusted to his
servants. Ask yourself which is the case in this instance.</p>

<p>I could say much more upon this subject&mdash;particularly to
state the effect which a resignation on these grounds would
have&mdash;but I am satisfied, from the tenour of your last letter,
that this is a step you will not adopt, except on more pressing
grounds.</p>

<p>I have not time to add anything more to this letter&mdash;not
even those assurances (which are, however, I trust, unnecessary)
of my constant, sincere, and zealous affection and interest
in whatever concerns you. You shall hear again from me at
latest by to-morrow's post.</p>

<p>Ever yours,<br/>
W. W. G.</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>MR. PITT TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.</p>

<p>Downing Street, July 3rd, 1788.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Lord</span>,</p>

<p>Nothing could happen to give me more pain than I have felt
from the contents of your letter of the 27th, and from the
circumstance which gave occasion to it. I trust, however, that
on full consideration you will see that there was, in some
respects, less ground than you imagined for the feelings under
which you wrote, and that what I have to mention to you will
do away every idea of your going to the extremity you mention;
which you must forgive my saying that the occasion can
never justify, either towards the public or yourself. It is most
certainly true that the general practice has been, and ought to
be, to wait for the Lord-Lieutenant's recommendation to vacant
commissions, and I undoubtedly understood that the King's
wishes respecting Colonel Gwynne were to be privately intimated
to you, so as to give you the opportunity of officially
recommending them.</p>

<p>I cannot, however, find that the general rule is founded in
anything but practice, or that there is any such promise as you
suppose in the instructions&mdash;that the King will wait for the
Lord-Lieutenant's recommendation to military commissions.
There is a clause containing a promise of this nature, but it
refers only to <i>ecclesiastical</i> and <i>civil</i> offices; and from the
manner in which commissions are mentioned in the preceding
article, as well as from the words of the Lord-Lieutenant's
commission, it appears by no means to apply to them. There
seems to me, therefore, to be, strictly speaking, nothing <i>irregular</i>
in the King's directing the appointment in the first
instance; though I most sincerely wish such a step had not
been taken, and am persuaded there is no danger of a repetition
of it. I mention this only to show that there is, at least, no
such ground for objecting in point of form to this proceeding<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</a></span>
as to compel you to take it up in the strong manner you
meditated.</p>

<p>But whatever weight you might give to this observation, I
trust from what you say in your letter, that you can in no
degree feel yourself called upon to carry the business any
further, unless on the supposition of receiving from Lord
Sydney an official answer, justifying his former letter. He
is far from having any intention of sending such an answer,
and I am sure, I can prevail upon him either to leave your
last letter without reply, or, if it will be more satisfactory to
you, to let both that and his letter which gave occasion to it
be withdrawn from the office. This is all which appears to me
to be now possible. The appointment having actually taken
place, and being warranted by the letter both of the instructions
and the commission, it is impracticable to propose anything
which would amount to disavowing the King's own act,
and renouncing a power which, though I hope he will not
again be inclined to exercise, he certainly seems to have
reserved in his own hands.</p>

<p>I therefore hope that one of the two expedients I have mentioned
will appear to you satisfactory, and I shall wait most
anxiously to know your wishes on the subject. As to any
intention in Lord Sydney or any one else to show any want of
attention personally to you, or to the situation you fill, I trust
you will feel the impossibility of such an intention existing;
because you must know that there can exist no one motive
for such an intention, and there exists, in fact, every motive
for the contrary.</p>

<p>With regard to the disappointment of your views for Colonel
Nugent, I say less on that subject, because, though I most
truly regret it, and most anxiously wish to find any means of
repairing it, I am persuaded from your letter, and from the
nature of the King, that the mere personal disappointment
is what you will not allow to influence your determination<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</a></span>
on a subject of so much consequence to the public service, and
to us all. I am satisfied, however, that you will find no difficulty
in obtaining your object for him on some more favourable
occasion, which I hope may occur before long; and if I can
find any way of making any arrangement on this side of the
water, which can make an opening earlier than it would
otherwise occur, you may depend upon my doing everything
I can for that purpose.</p>

<p>I have not time to add more now, but will write in a few
days in answer to your former letter. You will easily imagine
how impatiently I shall wait for an answer to this.</p>

<p>Believe me ever, my dear Lord,<br/>
Sincerely and affectionately yours,<br/>
<span class="smcap">W. Pitt</span>.</p>

<p>I enclose extracts of those parts of the instructions and commission
to which I refer.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>MR. W. W. GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.</p>

<p>Whitehall, July 14th, 1788.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Brother</span>,</p>

<p>I now sit down to answer your three letters of the 5th, the
8th, and the 9th, the last of which I received this morning. I
am much concerned that anything which I have said respecting
this business should have given you the impression of my having
treated it with unfairness towards you. I do most solemnly
assure you, that in every reflection that has passed in my mind
upon the subject, I have endeavoured to put myself in your
place, and to ask what line of conduct would be the most
desirable for you to adopt, with a view not only to any present
impression, but to your permanent reflections upon it. You
must allow me to say, that I persevere in my opinion, that your
resigning your office on this ground would neither be justified<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[Pg 411]</a></span>
in the opinion of the world in general, nor by your own
cooler reconsideration of the subject; and I must beg you to
observe that this is not my sentiment only, but that of every
one of the few other friends with whom you have communicated
upon it.</p>

<p>The only reason which you yourself adduce, in support of
such a measure, injurious to yourself and to your friends, is the
sort of impression which you say this transaction has made in
Dublin. To this I reply, in the first place, that I must still
think that you, of all men, who ever held that situation are exactly
in those circumstances in which you can have nothing to fear
from such an expression; and although I cannot refuse, on
your evidence, to believe the actual existence of such an impression,
yet I am fully satisfied that it can neither be permanent
in its duration, nor mischievous in its effects. But it
is surely at least sufficient, even in your view of the subject, if
such a solution accompanies this difficulty, as can leave no
doubt in the mind of any man that you have weight and
influence fully sufficient for carrying on the business of your
situation.</p>

<p>It is on this ground that you rest it, and I think with
great propriety, in your letter to Pitt, and his answer, which
you will receive with this, can hardly fail of proving to you that
you <i>was</i> premature in stating yourself to be abandoned by those
on whom you had claims. You cannot wonder that I, who had
seen the activity and zeal which he has shown in this business,
from his first being acquainted with it, should feel hurt at being
obliged to put into his hands a complaint from you so little
merited. I felt also that in the generality of that expression I
was myself involved, and you must allow me to say that I
could not reproach myself with having deserved it.</p>

<p>I trust, however, that there will be no occasion for the
exertions which Pitt engages himself to make on this subject,
and that your proposal will be acceded to by the King without<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[Pg 412]</a></span>
reluctance. It seems to me that Fawcitt shows a real disposition
to accommodate the wishes of Pitt and yourself, and
that the terms which he proposes are by no means unreasonable.
I sincerely hope that you will not find any difficulty in making
the arrangement for the sort of intermediate compensation,
which is effected before a Government fall. It has occurred to
me that, <i>faute de mieux</i>, Hobart's office might facilitate such a
plan. You know, I presume, that he is coming into Parliament
here, and, consequently, that he must be desirous of
making some arrangement with respect to his office which he
cannot well execute by deputy. I have a place to dispose of
at Chelsea (the Comptrollership), which might be made worth
about &pound;200 or &pound;250 per annum; but it is the sort of office
that Hobart himself could certainly not take or execute. I
have endeavoured to find some man fit for it, and who could
resign to Hobart a place of equal value, but I cannot find such
a man. Perhaps, in some way or other, this may be made
useful to you; but you must observe that the Comptroller
must be a man of steadiness, integrity, and some clearness of
head.</p>

<p>I do not know whether Fitzherbert has written to you about
Captain Macgrath. The King thinks him entitled to the
preference which he claims, but Lord Sydney does not send
over the despatch at present, as till this other business is settled
it might be unpleasant to you.</p>

<p>I do not very well see how he could avoid sending over
Gwynne's commission to you, as you yourself agree that there
could be no idea of the King's revoking the appointment which
he considered as a thing actually done. You will, I trust,
unquestionably think it better to issue this commission without
waiting the result of your negotiation with Fawcitt, as a few
days can make no difference in point of impression with respect
to a thing so publicly known, and the appearance of keeping it
back is not, I think, what you yourself wish. I confess, I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[Pg 413]</a></span>
think, there is the same sort of ground with respect to sending
over a recommendation ante-dated, which was not a part of Lord
Sydney's proposal as stated to you by Pitt; that was, that both
his letter and yours should be withdrawn. There could then
remain nothing but the commission, without any trace how it
was granted. Whereas, a recommendation of that sort must
be felt by the King as putting him avowedly in the wrong, and
to a greater extent than ever your construction of your commission
and instructions warrants. I think them more disputable
than you do, but they were sent not to prove that the
<i>notification</i> ought not to have been waited for, but that there
was, according to the letter of those papers, no necessity for the
<i>recommendation</i>. The mere writing to say that Lord C.'s
appointment vacates his lieutenant-colonelcy, is surely no
object to you; and a recommendation goes beyond the claim
you can urge under the instructions. If you are satisfied
with the assurances you have received that the substantial cause
of complaint, viz., the interference with your patronage, shall
not be repeated, it is surely better to let this business rest, than
to squabble with the King about the form of what has been done,
and which substantially you cannot alter.</p>

<p>We hear this evening that Lord J. Townshend is to oppose
Lord Hood.</p>

<p>Ever most affectionately yours,<br/>
W. W. G.</p></div>

<p>Lord Hood's contest for Westminster was now dividing
the attention of the Government with graver questions.
Mr. Grenville and Sir William Young furnish some
details, those of the latter bringing the features of the
scene vividly before us.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[Pg 414]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>MR. W. W. GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.</p>

<p>Whitehall, July 30th, 1788.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Brother</span>,</p>

<p>I have not written to you for the last ten or twelve days, on
account of my time being wholly taken up with the election. You
know me well enough to imagine, that a canvass of this sort for
a fortnight together, especially in such a place as Westminster,
was no very agreeable undertaking for me. We were, however,
in want of nothing but active exertion; and I felt that I owed
it to the cause in which we are embarked to set the example.
I am persuaded, that if this had been done a little sooner,
nothing could have prevented our success; but Lord Hood's
security for the first three days, and his total inactivity for
three days more, after the opposition had been declared, gave
the enemy so much the start of us, that it is wonderful we
should have been able to do what we have. As it is, Townshend
will certainly be returned. It is impossible, without more
minute inquiry, to speak with <i>real</i> confidence as to the event of
a petition. It is <i>unquestionable</i>, that their majority is owing to
bad votes, and to bribed votes; but in what proportion, it is not
yet possible to say. Before a Committee, it will be easy to
detect and strike off the former; but the proof of bribery is
often difficult, if not impossible. It must, therefore, depend on
a more minute inquiry to decide what probability there is of
succeeding in a petition. Even if we fail, this contest has, I
am satisfied, laid the foundation of an opposition at the general
election, not to Townshend only, but also to Fox. The advantage
of this you will easily see, is not the one vote, more or less,
in the House of Commons, or any <i>&eacute;clat</i> from this particular
place; but the benefit we shall derive from carrying the war
into their head-quarters, and engaging their attention to one
point&mdash;an object, which was, I am sure, of the utmost use to
us last time.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[Pg 415]</a></span></p>

<p>The election is not yet over, nor will Lord Hood decline the
poll. It will, therefore, last till Monday next, unless closed
before by the consent of both parties.</p>

<p>Lord Howard's peerage, with limitation to Neville, is settled;
and will, I believe, take place in a fortnight, at furthest. I
have this morning received your letter of Saturday last. You
do not mention in it what the sort of expectation is which you
wish to be enabled to hold out to Doyle in future. I shall, for
that reason, not say anything about it to Lord Sydney at
present, as nothing could be done in it till the King comes
back from Cheltenham; and by that time I may receive your
answer, without which I should be embarrassed what to ask or
press for.</p>

<p>I have not yet done anything about the Comptrollership of
Chelsea. I need not say, that your wishes (especially in behalf
of Tompkins, under all the circumstances which interest you
for him), are the most powerful of all considerations with me;
but I own that, from my knowledge of him, I cannot help
doubting how far he is equal to discharge an office of that sort
of detail, without involving himself and me in difficulties, which
would in the end be greatly distressing, even to yourself. You,
however, know him much better than I do; and I should
therefore be obliged to you, if you would consider this doubt,
and let me know what you think of it.</p>

<p>Lord Chatham is better, and goes on mending; but he is
not yet out. As far as I have an opportunity of judging, his
appointment has been well received.</p>

<p>I have been so pestered with that Hoghton, and his eternal
Ensign Maudesley, that I shall be obliged to write him word,
that if the young man will wait upon you, you will see him,
which is the only way that I see of putting an end to a weekly
correspondence on the subject.</p>

<p>Ever most affectionately yours,<br/>
W. W. G.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[Pg 416]</a></span></p>

<p>You have never sent me any answer about the Bucks Justices,
by which means I am offending Powis and the rest of
them; nor about the Cranbourne chair proposal, by which
means that business is delayed.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>SIR WILLIAM YOUNG TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.</p>

<p>London, August 10th, 1788.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Lord</span>,</p>

<p>The bustle of the Westminster election had thrown me so far
in arrears of private business, which pressed upon me in the
various items of correspondence, accounts, and papers, that I
have been obliged to delay this letter longer than I intended.
My attorney hath now his leave of absence from me, to anew
paint the green door, and repolish the brass knocker of his
country villa. As soon as Lady Y. is sufficiently strong I
propose quitting town, remaining ten days at Delaforde, and
then proceeding to swim at Southampton or Lymington, having
as just claim to breathe a sweeter air as the said attorney.</p>

<p>On Monday last, I quitted for a few hours the Westminster
contest, to dine with the Stoke Club, which was well attended,
and your Lordship's venison declared to be in high season.
Captain Salter hath suffered some severe loss of fortune from
the bankruptcy of the house of Maine, at Lisbon, as I understand;
in consequence thereof, he hath let his house at Stoke
to Major Masters, and means himself and family to reside at
Bath. He hath let his house for &pound;200 per annum, and for a
term.</p>

<p>Late in the evening, I hastened back from Slough to protect
my house, in case of a riot; but the precaution of the police, in
appointing for the occasion some hundreds of extra constables,
kept all quiet. The Foxites, aware of the circumstance, sought
to arrogate all credit from that tranquillity of the night which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[Pg 417]</a></span>
they could not prevent, and advertised "be quiet" accordingly.
Unprecedented modesty! I could wish to give some idea of
the conduct of the party, but cannot convey a just one. On
the hustings a daily farce passed, which even those busy in
the general scene, but who attended not that spot, can have
no conception of.</p>

<p>At dinner, in Downing Street, I was requested to take "my
day or two station" on the hustings; it being necessary to
have some gentlemen there who might notice procedure, and
prevent the high bailiff yielding in every case to the most
abject fears on every threat of Mr. Fox, which he did, insomuch
that Lord Apsley and myself were obliged to threaten
him with a prosecution. On the hustings were posted a set of
young men, neatly dressed in blue and buff for the occasion,
blacklegs from all the race-courses, and all the Pharo and E.O.
tables in town. Their business was to affront every gentleman
who came on the hustings without their livery. "You lie!"
"Who are you? damn you!" and a variety of such terms
echoed in every quarter; something of the sort soon tingled in
my ears.</p>

<p>On observing a dirty-looking man encouraged to swear, and
not mind <i>that fellow</i>, meaning your humble servant, I could
not refrain expressing my disgust, at hearing even invitations
to a disregard of perjury; on which, Counsellor Garrow, of
Newgate education, addressed me with, "Damn your eyes and
limbs! and who are you, who give yourself these airs?"
Having made up my mind to put a stop, <i>in limine</i>, to such
mode of address, I gave him my card, and told him we had
better settle the rest of the business elsewhere, "and immediately."
He was for the first time in his life abashed, and
made excuses, which I gladly enough accepted; observing aloud,
that being incapable of using an illiberal term, I should in
similar manner <i>insist</i> on none being used towards me. I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[Pg 418]</a></span>
was afterwards treated civilly for that place. I have mentioned
the above anecdote, as characteristic of the deportment
of the blue and buff for special purpose of clearing the
hustings; and too often they succeeded, occasioning moderate
men, who did not choose to commit themselves, to withdraw;
and thus getting whole divisions of the hustings to themselves,
where they polled every beggar from the streets. The question
is not of title to vote in most cases, but of identity; most
families being at this season out of town, a rascal was found
to personate every absentee. The suborners of perjury not
regularly conferring, very many instances occur of an absentee
being represented by four or five, <i>all</i> admitted to vote on their
mere attestation.</p>

<p>The petition, I understand, will be founded on bribery, as well
as other allegations of violence, and false votes. Details of
bribery advanced are numerous, and well attested; but I doubt
if it can be brought home to direct agency. The publicans,
who immediately distributed the money, whom we know, and
who may turn informers to save themselves, will probably only
have to tell us of a false name and a disguised person; however,
Lord Hood and his solicitors are more sanguine.</p>

<p>It is generally understood that future elections in Westminster
are to be regulated by a new statute, the heads of
which are to be: parochial polls, churchwardens and overseers,
and inspectors, and parish rate-books conclusive, if against any
voter&mdash;that is to say, if his name is not there.</p>

<p>Our second dinner of the Constitutional Club, on Wednesday,
went off exceedingly well, and may prove a good
political net to catch young men just launching into the
world from College. Such use hath been made of the Whig
Club, and something was wanting to counteract. Other good
effects, not merely confined to a Westminster election, may too
have place. In short, the late business seems to have awakened<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[Pg 419]</a></span>
us all to our good cause and just political interests, as well as
to have drilled us against the period of our being called out to
the general election.</p>

<p>I shall not leave town till the 1st of September, and ere I
quit it shall again make my remittance of such news as occurs.</p>

<p>My last boy is a fine fellow, and my wife is as well as possible.
She desires in the best manner to be kindly remembered
to the Marchioness, with, my dear Lord, your ever affectionately
faithful, and obliged friend and servant,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">W. Young</span>.</p></div>

<p>If we did not know that matters of higher import
engaged the attention of the Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland, it
might almost appear that his chief business consisted in
controlling the pretensions of a variety of persons to every
office that fell vacant, and of keeping a host of disappointed
expectants in check and good-humour, so large a
space does this matter of patronage occupy in the semi-official
correspondence of the period. Amongst the most
urgent of them was the appointment of Fitzgibbon (afterwards
Earl of Clare) to the Chancellorship of Ireland,
which Lord Lifford was daily expected to resign.</p>

<p>Lord Lifford seems to have been a man of limited
capacity and singular simplicity of character, formal and
credulous, and tedious in his intercourse with the world.
His letters to Lord Buckingham, written in a great clerkly
hand, are full of solemn platitudes and ceremonious
civilities; and whatever other excellent qualities he possessed,
it cannot be inferred that he was a man of much
mental reach or vigour. Obsolete in manners and ideas,
and living in the modes of a past age, he was respected
for the sincerity of his disposition and the rectitude of his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[Pg 420]</a></span>
character, rather than for the strength or activity of his
intellect. In his seventy-fourth year he came over to
London to resign the Seals to His Majesty, laden with the
burden of years and hypochondriacal infirmities; yet, up
to the last, vacillating in his resolution. Lord Mornington,
who met him at dinner at Pitt's during this visit,
says: "I met old Lifford at dinner at Pitt's, and never
saw him look in better health or spirits; he is, as you
may well believe, most generally <i>quizzed</i> in London."
The letter in which he announces to Lord Buckingham
his intention of resigning of the Seals, after many misgivings
before he could make up his mind to it, is thoroughly
characteristic.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>LORD LIFFORD TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.</p>

<p>Royal Hotel, Pall Mall,</p>

<p>Saturday, August 30th, 1788.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My very good Lord</span>,</p>

<p>My complaints at times to your Excellency, and my apprehensions
expressed to you that bodily weakness and the infirmities
of old age were coming upon me apace, will prevent
your Excellency from being much surprised when I tell you
that my journey hither, which at first I thought would have
relieved me, hath served only to confirm me in the apprehensions
I had conceived that the hour of infirmity, which is
an enemy to all exertion, and first weakens and slackens the
course of business, and soon afterwards disables, was not
far off.</p>

<p>I now grow so clumsy and weak in my limbs, and so
soon grow tired and fatigued to a degree painful to me, that
although my mind seems as well as ever, yet I am sure that
I cannot long do my duty, and there is nothing I dread so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[Pg 421]</a></span>
much as sitting upon a great seat of justice as a kind of ruin,
and in a state of decay. In my seventy-fourth year, I am
not sure that avarice may not lay hold of me, and tempt me
to stay where I am, until I feel or am made to feel, by being
told that I have stayed too long; and that peevishness too,
an attendant upon old age, may not put an end to that
command of temper, which I have ever endeavoured to preserve;
and that, with such enemies to fair fame, I may soon
impair and sully the character and esteem which I may at
present have.</p>

<p>Under these impressions, my wishes to retire become divided,
which they were not until within these few days past. I should
have been happy in first declaring this to you, wishing in everything
to do that which but expresses my sincere attachment
to and regard for your Excellency. But being going into the
royal presence, I resolved to lay myself at His Majesty's feet,
and express to him my apprehensions and my wishes to retire,
if I could do so in a manner honourable and convenient to
myself, when His Majesty's service would admit of it. Accordingly,
yesterday, in the closet, I did as I had resolved. His
Majesty's kindness and goodness to me was beyond what I can
express. Retirement, before decay actually comes on, meets
his ideas perfectly; and I have every reason to think that I am
lucky in the choice I have made of the present opportunity.</p>

<p>I have also communicated my wishes to Mr. Pitt, who received
me with attention and kindness. He said he would confer
with His Majesty upon the subject, and forthwith communicate
the matter to you, without whose participation and concurrence
I cannot be at ease and happy. Upon a measure of such
importance as this is to me, I exceedingly wish that you should
be possessed of the motives and principles upon which I act;
and I will state them to you without reserve. But permit me first
to say, that I hope and think that avarice cannot be imputed
to me; for, parting with &pound;10,000 per annum, for what must<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[Pg 422]</a></span>
be greatly below it, excludes the imputation. Ambition must
be equally out of the question, for I want no advancement in
the Peerage.</p>

<p>Now, as to my motives and principles at this time. I am in
my seventy-fourth year, and although my mind, assisted by
experience for a number of years, that makes few things new
to me, may be as good as ever, yet the weakness of my limbs,
my inability to go through any bodily fatigue, and many other
monitions that tell me the day of great infirmity is at hand,
ought not to be unattended to by any man who hath sound
sense or any religion about him.</p>

<p>I stand well, as I flatter myself, with the people of Ireland,
to whom I have administered justice for more than twenty
years, with both Houses of Parliament, and with the Bar of
Ireland; with all of whom I have lived without a quarrel with
any man, but I hope without forgetting what belonged to me
to be mindful of.</p>

<p>The country of Ireland quiet beyond what I have known it
at any time: a circumstance corresponding and consisting with
my declarations, at all times, that I would not ever be found
to act like a man who leaves the ship in a storm. And to
these I hope I may add that I have friends in Administration;
that, in particular, I have a friend in your Excellency; and that,
although in one of our last conversations you concluded your
expressions of great kindness with something that threatened
reluctance to my retirement, yet it was done with a countenance
and in a manner that flattered me with hopes that there
was a friendship under it, that would afford me your assistance
whenever the occasion should direct me to look up to and
solicit your Excellency for it.</p>

<p>All these circumstances concurring (and so many concurring
together I cannot, according to a reasonable calculation
of human affairs, much expect), determined me to do as I have
done. I have struggled to overcome my passion for my office<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[Pg 423]</a></span>
in Ireland; but I submit, because I am worn out, or rather am
as near being worn out as, I think, a man who wishes to preserve
a dignity of character should approach to. I have exceedingly
wished to afford your Excellency every assistance in my
power during your Administration; and if I retire from the
Great Seal, I shall most certainly retain that wish, and display
it by such proof as you can desire, and as I can with the
warmest attachment afford you. Your Excellency will be a
gainer by a change, as you will have the exertions of a younger
and more vigorous man, and my best help added to it.</p>

<p>I did not come out of the King's closet until between six
and seven yesterday evening, and I was then so fatigued that I
could not set pen to paper.</p>

<p>I have not said anything upon this subject to anybody here,
save only to the King and Mr. Pitt.</p>

<p>Permit me to beg your Excellency's friendship in this matter,
that so much concerns me and my family. Your kindness in
it, you may rely upon it, will never be forgotten by me, and I
shall transmit the remembrance of it to those who are to come
after me. I have now done, and have the honour to be, with
the most sincere attachment and respect, my very good Lord,
your Excellency's most faithful and most obedient, humble
servant,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lifford</span>.</p>

<p>His Excellency the Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland</p></div>

<p>The only obstruction to the appointment of Fitzgibbon,
was the disqualifying circumstance of his birth. It was
held to be a dangerous precedent to appoint an Irishman
to the office; but it was maintained on the other side,
that Fitzgibbon's was an exceptional case, and could not
pass into a precedent. Having come to London, to see<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[Pg 424]</a></span>
Mr. Pitt on the subject, he writes thus to Lord Buckingham:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>MR. FITZGIBBON TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.</p>

<p>No. 5, Arlington Street, Oct. 6th, 1788.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Lord</span>,</p>

<p>Immediately after my arrival in England I saw Mr. Pitt, and
mentioned to him that I had your Excellency's authority to say
that Lord Lifford had, a very few days before he left Ireland,
intimated a wish to resign the Great Seal. Under the impression
of the opinion you were so good to give me, I did not go
further than to request of Mr. Pitt that he would apprise me of
any vacancy which might happen in the first instance, that I
might have a fair opportunity of stating my claims, which I
considered to be pretty strong, upon the King's Government,
not to be passed by in any promotion which might take place
in the line of my profession. This he has promised to do;
but I have not since heard from him. However, I waited upon
the Chancellor a few days since, and he told me that Lord
Lifford had, when he was in town, intimated his wishes to
Mr. Pitt, as he had done to your Excellency, not to return to
Ireland. I am confident, however, that nothing is finally
arranged, either with respect to accepting Lord Lifford's resignation,
or appointing a successor to him, or I should have
heard from Mr. Pitt.</p>

<p>The Chancellor's reception of me was very flattering, as he
was pleased unequivocally to declare his good opinion of me as
a public and a professional man; and from what fell from him,
I have reason to suppose that with your Excellency's support,
and Mr. Pitt's approbation, I shall not meet any opposition
from him. What Mr. Pitt's sentiments upon the subject may
be, I have not a conjecture, as he never in any degree opened<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[Pg 425]</a></span>
himself to me, further than in general terms of his personal
good opinion of me. With him, however, I must conclude
that your Excellency's recommendation would be decisive.</p>

<p>Lord Lifford returns to London on the 20th of this month,
and I must suppose that very shortly after, something decisive
will be done. One thing is extremely clear&mdash;that if he should
return to Ireland, he cannot very long remain in his present
situation. And, circumstanced as I am in that country, your
Excellency cannot wonder that I wish fairly to see my way. I
shall therefore certainly endeavour, before I leave London, to
possess myself of Mr. Pitt's sentiments upon this subject; to
which end, it will be very material to me that he should be
possessed of your Excellency's. May I therefore request of
you, to give me such an answer to this letter as I may show to
him. Your Excellency, I am satisfied, most perfectly understands,
that I am not by any means anxious to quit my present
situation, and that so long as I continue to hold it, I will
continue to serve the Crown with zeal and fidelity. My only
object at present is, fairly to know the ground upon which I
stand on this side of the water. The very open and friendly
communications which your Excellency has had the goodness to
make to me from your first arrival in Ireland, leave me no room
to doubt of my situation there.</p>

<p>I have the honour to be, my Lord, with perfect respect and
esteem, your Excellency's obedient and very humble servant,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John Fitzgibbon</span>.</p>

<p>His Excellency the Marquis of Buckingham.</p></div>

<p>Up to this time, notwithstanding the interview with
the King, Lord Lifford had not relinquished the Seals.
Lord Buckingham was in favour of Fitzgibbon's claims,
but seems to have been a little plagued by the incessant<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[Pg 426]</a></span>
correspondence in which they involved him, especially
as he had strong reasons for desiring to postpone the
retirement of the Chancellor. "I again say," he writes
to Fitzgibbon in one of the numerous epistles this affair
cost him, "that nothing will make me happier than your
success; but for very many reasons, which I frankly
stated to you, I trust that the opening will not be made
immediately, and I as fairly tell you that I will not
<i>facilitate</i> it. You know what I mean by all this mystery."
He did <i>not</i> facilitate it; and Fitzgibbon was compelled
to wait upon the convenience of Government.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile, some new vexations had arisen
between Lord Buckingham and the Ministry; but what
they were, does not appear.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>MR. W. W. GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.</p>

<p>Castlehill, Sept. 20th, 1788.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Brother</span>,</p>

<p>Your letter of the 14th reached me here this morning. I
say nothing to you of the feelings which have been excited in
my mind, by your detail of the particulars of your situation,
because I am sure that you do justice to my sentiments on
such a subject. Pitt has written to desire me to meet him at
Burton on Monday next; and in the present state of this
business, I feel peculiarly anxious for an opportunity of
conversing with him upon it.</p>

<p>It is unquestionably better in every point of view, that I
should have such an opportunity before I go over to you;
and I am persuaded you would not wish me to neglect this.
After I have seen him, as I shall then be within little more
than a day's journey from town, I shall wish to return there<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[Pg 427]</a></span>
for a day or two, even if I should immediately afterwards set
out for Ireland. But you may assure yourself, that if I should
see any reason to think that my going over there could be of
the least service, or advantage to you, I will not let any
personal inconvenience stand in the way of it so long as it
continues possible.</p>

<p>It gives me an inexpressible satisfaction to find, from your
letter, that Pitt's conduct to you in this instance has been such
as I expected. If I am not grossly deceived in the opportunities
which I have had of observing his character and
disposition, you will find his behaviour uniformly the same
on every other occasion that may occur. I make you no
assurances on this occasion with respect to myself, having a
pleasure in thinking them unnecessary.</p>

<p>I confess the motive for this whole transaction, in the quarter
where it evidently originates, is to me utterly inexplicable; the
whole being so entirely inconsistent with every idea that I can
form to myself of <i>his</i> situation, his present or future views, his
interest, or his personal feelings. I by no means think the
circumstance which you mention sufficient to afford a clue for
it; and the more I reflect upon it, the more incomprehensible
it seems to me.</p>

<p>Adieu, my dear brother; whatever, and wherever you are.</p>

<p>Believe me ever most sincerely and affectionately yours,<br/>
W. W. G.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>MR. W. W. GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.</p>

<p>(Most Secret.) Whitehall, Oct. 22nd, 1788.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Brother</span>,</p>

<p>I have just received your letter of the 18th. You will have
seen, by my last, the delay which has arisen in examining Lord
Nugent's papers, and proving his will, on account of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[Pg 428]</a></span>
absence of Macnamara and the Drummonds. I sent off a
messenger to the former immediately after I had written to
you; and have received an answer from him, by which I
understand he will be in town on Thursday night.</p>

<p>23rd.&mdash;I was interrupted yesterday, and could not, by any
contrivance, return to finish my letter, though I was anxious
that you should hear from me, that there has as yet been no
sort of difficulty or interruption; and I conclude, therefore,
that there will be none.</p>

<p>I have forwarded your letter to the Chancellor, and added to
it one from myself. I mean, <i>if possible</i>, to see him, though
that, you know, is no easy matter, as I understand the Duke
of Grafton is asking it, at Selby's request, for a man who was
active against me. I could wish that you would write Wodley
a few lines, to explain that you were hampered by former
engagements, &amp;c., as I found from a conversation with
Camplin, that he had been perfectly satisfied with the explanation
you had with him on the subject of Newport, and that
he was in expectation of having this. Camplin thinks him of
considerable importance.</p>

<p>My impatience, in the letter to which your last was an
answer, was owing to my having made no allowance for east
winds, which detained the mail near a week, and brought me
two of your letters together. You must, therefore, excuse a
very unprovoked lecture on punctuality.</p>

<p>I wish I could say to you that anything more is done about
your commissions; but this has been, and continues to be,
absolutely impossible, for a reason which gives us all no small
degree of uneasiness&mdash;I mean the King's illness, which begun
with a violent spasmodic attack in his stomach; and has continued
with more or less violence, and with different symptoms
ever since. We put as good a face as we can upon it; and,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[Pg 429]</a></span>
indeed, I hope that the danger is now over, but I cannot but
own to you that I think there is still ground for a good deal
of alarm. He brought on this particular attack by the great
imprudence of remaining a whole day in wet stockings; but,
on the whole, I am afraid that his health is evidently much
worse than it has been, and that there is some lurking disorder
in his constitution, which he has not strength to throw out. I
have again mentioned to Pitt the subject of the commissions;
and he has promised to endeavour to bring it to a conclusion as
soon as the King is sufficiently recovered to allow him to see
him on that business. But this may yet be some time, as a
part of the King's disorder is an agitation and flurry of spirits,
which hardly gives him any rest. I need not mention to you,
that I should not allow myself to say all this, but in the
strictest confidence, and that, independently of the King's great
dislike to its being known that he is ill, we have the strongest
reasons of policy, both foreign and domestic, in the present
moment particularly, to wish that idea not to prevail.</p>

<p>Your conjecture about Denmark and Sweden, and your subsequent
reasoning upon it, are both perfectly just. The Cabinet
of the former is, in the present moment, entirely subservient to
the views of Russia, which are to annihilate Sweden, and
thereby to gain the entire dominion of the north. Both
Prussia and England have a strong and evident interest to
prevent the accomplishment of this plan, but it can be done
only by a vigorous exertion. Such an exertion is now making;
and I certainly think that if we had any enemies able to stir, it
would involve us in a most unwelcome, though necessary war.
But I rely with no little confidence upon the weakness of France,
whose difficulties, instead of being at all diminished, are hourly
increasing; their public credit falling even below what it was at
the time of Neckar's appointment, and their discontents again
getting to the most serious pitch. Add to this, that we have
every reason to believe that we have the concurrence and good<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[Pg 430]</a></span>
wishes of Spain in the object which we are pursuing, and I
think we have, I may say, nothing to apprehend from measures
which would, in any other situation of Europe, be most critical
indeed. The K. of P. has already <i>required</i> Denmark
to evacuate Sweden, under the threat of the invasion of
Holstein; and we are seconding him with remonstrances very
near as strong, though couched in more conciliatory terms. It
remains to see what she will do.</p>

<p>I am called away, and have only time to add that the account
of the King this morning, from Sir G. Baker, is <i>much</i> more
favourable; and that if he does well, there is a plan now, I
believe settled, by which the arrangement about which you
inquire will certainly take place before the meeting of Parliament.</p>

<p>Ever most affectionately yours,<br/>
W. W. G.</p></div>

<p>The lecture on punctuality alluded to, occurs in a previous
letter, in which Mr. Grenville said: "I earnestly
wish you would answer the questions I put to you about
your own business with a little more punctuality. I know
your other avocations; but you cannot conceive how distressing
your silence often is to me."</p>

<p>In the above letter, which is marked "most secret," we
have the first announcement of the King's illness and its
origin. The utmost pains were taken to conceal it from the
public; and two days afterwards the King went to the
lev&eacute;e, to dissipate suspicion. "I find from Pitt," says
Mr. Grenville, writing on the 25th, "that the King went
to the lev&eacute;e yesterday, in order to show himself, but that
he was very weak and unfit for business." The effect of
the appearance at the lev&eacute;e is subsequently described.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[Pg 431]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>MR. W. W. GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.</p>

<p>Whitehall, Oct. 26th, 1788.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Brother</span>,</p>

<p>I am very sorry to be obliged to give you a less favourable
account of the King's health than that which you received by
my last letter. His appearance at the lev&eacute;e on Friday was an
effort beyond his strength, but made with a view of putting an
end to the stories that were circulated with much industry. He
has, however, considerably weakened himself by it, and his
physician now declares that rest, and an absolute cessation from
all business, are of indispensable necessity to him. I am much
mortified at the delay which this occasions in the final conclusion
of the business about your commissions; but you must easily
see that, in the present crisis, it must be productive of other
bad consequences, which you would yourself think of more
importance. God knows what the result of it will be. The
present situation is sufficiently embarrassing; but if it turns
out ill, all sense of personal inconvenience, mortification, or
disappointment, will, I fear, be lost in considerations of infinitely
greater moment. At present, however, there is, I believe,
unquestionably no danger; but I cannot divest myself of the
persuasion that these are only the symptoms of some disorder
lurking in his constitution, and which he has not sufficient
strength of habit to throw out. I need not say that you may
depend upon hearing from me as often as I hear anything
authentic as to his situation, and that if I do not write constantly,
it will only be because I have nothing new to communicate
on which I can at all depend.</p>

<p>There are no fresh accounts from the Bannat. The troops of
Denmark, acting in Sweden, had agreed on the 10th to a
suspension of hostilities for eight days, and there seemed reason
to hope that this period would be prolonged. They had passed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[Pg 432]</a></span>
the Gothelba on which Gothenburg stands, but had retreated
again beyond it.</p>

<p>27th.&mdash;I have heard no further account of the King. The
story which you will see in the papers about Lord Holland, is,
I believe, utterly unfounded. I have found the list of the
deeds, &amp;c., contained in the iron chest. Camplin says that
Colonel Nugent has two duplicates of it. I have therefore
directed him to send the list itself over to you by this day's
post. You will see that Lord G. B.'s renunciation deed is not
mentioned in the list; and Camplin, who made the list, says he
never heard of it.</p>

<p>Ever yours,<br/>
W. W. G.</p></div>

<p>The letters that follow, depict the distressing anxieties
which, day by day, throughout this painful interval, attended
the progress of the fatal malady.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>MR. W. W. GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.</p>

<p>Whitehall,</p>

<p>Nov. 5th, 1788, Five o'clock.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Brother</span>,</p>

<p>I have delayed till this hour writing to you to-day, as I have
nothing of any consequence to write about, excepting the
King's health; and I wished to send you the account which
I have just received from Pitt, and which I now enclose.
The general alarm on the subject is very great, and it is
impossible not to feel that so long an illness without
much amendment, if any on the whole, and without coming
to any crisis, has a most serious appearance. You may
naturally conceive the exultation, not wearing even the
appearance of disguise, which there is in one party, and the
depression of those who belong to the other. I think some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[Pg 433]</a></span>
few days more must now decide the point, not, perhaps, by the
blow actually happening within that time, which I trust there
can be no reason to fear, but by showing whether he has
strength sufficient in his constitution to throw out the disorder
which is evidently lurking in it, and which will otherwise
infallibly destroy it by no very slow degrees.</p>

<p>Ever most affectionately yours,<br/>
W. W. G.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>MR. W. W. GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.</p>

<p>Whitehall, Nov. 7th, 1788.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Brother</span>,</p>

<p>I waited yesterday before I wrote to you, in the hopes of
seeing Pitt, who had promised to call upon me, and carry me
to the place where we were to dine; but he was delayed by a
visit from the Chancellor so long, that I found myself too late
for the post.</p>

<p>I sincerely wish that I had better news to communicate to
you; but I believe you must consider the thing as completely
over. The King has now been two days entirely delirious, and
during part of the time has been thought to be in the most
imminent danger. It now appears that Warren, Heberden and Sir
G. Baker, who are the three physicians who attend him, profess
themselves unable to decide whether the disorder is or is not
of such a nature as may soon produce a crisis which may lead
either to health or death. The other alternative is one to which
one cannot look without horror&mdash;that of a continuance of the
present derangement of his faculties, without any other effect
upon his health. He is certainly at present stronger in body
than he has been, but I understand with much fever. I believe the
general idea of his danger is now very prevalent; but we endeavour
(I know not with what success) to keep these particulars as
much as we can from the public. I have ventured to write<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[Pg 434]</a></span>
this and a former letter by the post, because you do not seem
to have entertained any apprehensions that, under the sort of
precautions which I take in sealing, &amp;c., this mode is unsafe;
and I think they are such as must have enabled you to detect
any improper tricks being played. The sending a messenger
would give so much alarm, that I thought it much better to
avoid it. If the event happens, which there is now so much
reason to dread, it is possible that I may have much to write to
you, and I should not then have the same confidence in the
post. For this reason I have enclosed a paper, of which you
know the use. It is a transcript of what you left with me,
which I have been prevented sending you before, and cannot
send now. Bernard can supply it in a temporary manner with
pasteboard.</p>

<p>Fox is not yet returned, nor have we as yet any ground for
judging of the immediate measures which would be taken,
beyond those which result from former conduct and language.</p>

<p>Since I wrote the above, I understand that Lord Sydney
sends off a messenger. Lest, however, there should be any
mistake in this, I send this letter by the post. The enclosure
I will send by the messenger.</p>

<p>I received your letter of the 3rd this morning. You may
easily conceive that I cannot now enter into the particulars of
it. I will only say that, with regard to the papers, I am
persuaded that, if you yourself have an opportunity of conversing
with M. (as is perhaps too probable), there will be no
difficulty in anything which you desire.</p>

<p>Ever most affectionately yours,<br/>
W. W. G.</p>

<p>There is one point on which I much wish for your answer,
with as little delay as possible. Suppose an immediate dissolution,
and an opposition started in Bucks&mdash;as will certainly be
the case, either for one or both members&mdash;would you have me
stand? I mention this, because the delay may be decisive.</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[Pg 435]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>MR. W. W. GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.</p>

<p>Nov. 7th, 1788.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Brother</span>,</p>

<p>I have written to you by this day's post, and now take the
opportunity of Lord Sydney's messenger. I am afraid that it
would be very sanguine indeed to say that there is even <i>any</i> hope
that the King will recover both his health and his understanding,
though the physicians do not say that it is absolutely impossible
for his disorder to have a crisis which may produce such an
effect. His disease is now almost entirely confined to his brain.
He has all along had an agitation of spirits, which has been
gradually increasing; and for these two days he has been quite
delirious. It is apprehended that this is the effect either of
water on the brain, or of an ossification of the membrane. If
it is only an humour checked, it is still possible that he might
throw it out by some violent crisis, such as either to destroy
him, or entirely to restore him. But this, I again repeat, there
seems little reason to hope.</p>

<p>If his indisposition of mind continues, without some more
material bodily illness, he may live years in this melancholy
state; and this, of all events that can happen, is perhaps the
most to be feared. He was, however, thought yesterday to be
in imminent danger of death. Should this not happen, but
the other, it seems generally agreed that the Prince of Wales
must be appointed Regent, with kingly power.</p>

<p>We have no grounds on which to judge of our own situation,
except from such conjectures as you are equally able to form on
the grounds of the P.'s former conduct and language.</p>

<p>He sent yesterday for Thurlow to Windsor; and about half
an hour ago, Pitt received a note from the Chancellor, who is
returned to town, saying that the P. had commanded him to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[Pg 436]</a></span>
desire Pitt's attendance at Windsor to-morrow morning at
eleven.</p>

<p>Pitt is gone to call upon the Chancellor, to learn the nature of
his conversation of yesterday. We understood that the object of
his going down yesterday was only that he might be consulted
as to the steps that might safely be taken with the King in his
present unhappy situation. The message of to-day looks like
something more, though it seems too early for any negotiation,
even if other considerations made that probable.</p>

<p>Fox is out of England, but has, as we understand, been sent
for. It appears a great question whether they will offer any
negotiation, or, if they do, what measures ought to be pursued.
I think the opinions rather lean to the idea that Pitt cannot at
once decline all negotiation, but that he will be sufficiently
grounded in refusing to listen to any proposal that shall not
leave him in his present situation, from whence he cannot be
removed without disgrace and degradation.</p>

<p>I need not say, that I am very desirous of knowing your
sentiments on the possible circumstances that may arise out of
this melancholy event, and that without them, I shall enter into
no engagements with a view to any new Government.</p>

<p>As these events may possibly produce much interesting
discussion, which I should be unwilling to trust to the post, I
have enclosed a transcript of our cypher, not having got a
duplicate. It can easily be made for present use either with
paper or pasteboard.</p>

<p>Ever most affectionately yours,<br/>
W. W. G.</p>

<p>My own persuasion is, that they will not attempt to negotiate
at all, but turn us all out at once, which I am sure is the
thing we ought most to wish. I trust I am not mistaken in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[Pg 437]</a></span>
the confidence that you wish, in this, or indeed any other course
that this situation may give rise to, that I should act in the
fullest concert with Pitt; whom, indeed, I could not desert
without the most despicable ingratitude.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>MR. NEVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.</p>

<p>Stanlake, Nov. 7th, 1788.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dearest Lord B.</span>,</p>

<p>I have but one moment, before the post goes out, to tell you
that I am this instant returned from Windsor; and find from
the best authority that the King's life is unfortunately despaired
of. Warren, Heberden, Baker, and Reynolds are attending.
I believe the fever has settled on the brain, as there is much
delirium. The Chancellor was at Windsor last night, and all
the Princes of the Blood are sitting up in the next room to
him. The Queen has had fits, but is better to-day.</p>

<p>Doubtless your situation will enable you to hear sooner
and more authentically, but I could not avoid giving you
myself this lamentable detail.</p>

<p>The Prince seems frightened, and was blooded yesterday.</p>

<p>Kate undertook to write in my name to Hester, instead of
you and Lady B. I sincerely condole with her, and hope soon
to hear a better account of her.</p>

<p>(Most Private.) Whitehall, Nov. 7th, 1788.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Lord</span>,</p>

<p>It is with the utmost concern and mortification that I am
under the necessity of acquainting your Excellency of the
dangerous state in which His Majesty's health has been for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[Pg 438]</a></span>
these last two days. Notwithstanding the various reports which
you may have seen, real symptoms of danger did not appear
till yesterday. The disorder, about the middle of yesterday,
attacked His Majesty's head, and he has had a very indifferent
night, and, I am afraid, is not much better to-day.</p>

<p>The Queen supports herself with her usual good sense and
fortitude, but is still much affected both in health and spirits,
though tolerably composed.</p>

<p>His Majesty, during his whole illness, has had the consolation
of receiving the unremitted attention of the whole
Royal Family, of the value of which he has shown himself
affectingly sensible.</p>

<p>In short, my dear Lord, the case may not be desperate; but
it is full of extreme danger. God send us a happy issue of it.</p>

<p>My best respects to Lady Buckingham and Lord Temple.
I write, as you may imagine, in great confusion and anxiety.</p>

<p>I am, with great esteem and regard,<br/>
Your Excellency's most obedient, humble servant.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>MR. W. W. GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.</p>

<p>Whitehall, Nov. 8th, 1788.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Brother</span>,</p>

<p>I am afraid that I shall be obliged to send this letter away
without any particular or authentic account of the King. Pitt
is gone down to Windsor this morning, and is not yet returned;
unless he comes back before the post goes out I shall have
little more than common report to send you.</p>

<p>I understand the immediate object of the Prince's desiring to
see him, was to inquire about a paper which the Queen imagined
the King had put into Pitt's hands respecting an arrangement
for the younger part of his family; but Pitt has no such
paper.</p>

<p>The latest authentic account I have seen, was a note which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[Pg 439]</a></span>
Pitt received from Sir G. Baker, about nine yesterday evening,
and which was, therefore, probably written about six or seven.
He then says that the King appeared better in his health, but
that there seemed reason to fear that his delirium would be
permanent. And this, I am sure, you will agree with me in
thinking the worst thing than can happen.</p>

<p>Since that, the idea is, as far as I can collect from a variety
of different reports, that his fever was considerably increased
afterwards, and that between two and four this morning he was
in the utmost danger, but that he is since better. One account
adds, but I am afraid to give credit to it, that he was relieved
by the bursting of a swelling on one of his legs, and by a very
great discharge from it. Some crisis of that sort is unquestionably
the only thing to which we can look with any reasonable
ground of hope for the recovery both of his health and of his
faculties. But this very consideration makes me very backward
in giving credit to this report, unless it had more foundation
than any which I can trace for it.</p>

<p>In the event which Sir George Baker's note gives reason to
apprehend, there will be the greatest embarrassment as to the
mode in which it is possible to proceed to any appointment of
a Regent. The Parliament is now prorogued only till the 23rd
instant, and must meet at that time, because no person but the
King has authority to prorogue it further. But, as you well
know, Parliament cannot proceed to business without the
session being opened by the King, or by some Commission
authorized by him. No Regent can be appointed or authorized
to exercise acts of royal authority but by Act of Parliament;
nor can any such Act be valid and binding in law without the
King's consent.</p>

<p>The Revolution affords the only thing like a precedent even
for the principles on which we can proceed; and yet that is a
case widely different from the present, because then the person
possessed of the right was declared either to have abdicated<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[Pg 440]</a></span>
that right, or forfeited it, or both. Here the King may not
live many years under an incapacity of exercising the right,
and yet may afterwards be restored to his faculties.</p>

<p>It is a heavy calamity that is inflicted upon us in any case
except that of his perfect recovery; but in the event which
there seems most ground to fear, it may give rise to serious and
difficult questions, such as cannot even be discussed without
shaking the security and tranquillity of the country.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Brother</span>,</p>

<p>I am much concerned that I was obliged to send off my
letter yesterday evening, and the rather as there will be no
opportunity of sending this till to-morrow. I find that there
was not the least foundation for any part of the reports which I
mentioned to you.</p>

<p>Pitt came back last night. He said the physicians do not
apprehend present danger, but that their fear is that the
insanity will be permanent, but they will not pronounce anything
yet. The Prince had a long conversation with him
relating to the King's situation, but nothing from which he
could collect what he thought of doing in the two cases that
may arise. The general notion is, that he will try to negotiate
with Pitt from the fear of his popularity; but I do not think
it probable. He treated Pitt with civility, but nothing more.</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[Pg 441]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>MR. W. W. GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.</p>

<p>Sunday, Nov. 9th, 1788.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Brother</span>,</p>

<p>There was no truth in any of the reports which I mentioned
to you in my letter by the post yesterday. Pitt came back to
town last night about nine, and afterwards called here. He
had seen all the physicians, and had much conversation with
them. They seemed still unwilling, or unable, to decide as to
the nature of his disorder; but Warren appeared to incline to
the opinion of an ossification. They told him that they had
determined, as an experiment, to give the King medicines to
remove his fever, in order to observe whether this produced
any effect on the state of his mind, and to draw an inference
from that whether the disorder on his brain was connected
with the fever. They accordingly gave him two doses of
James's powder in the course of the day, but without any other
effect than lowering his pulse; and this morning we have the
severe mortification of hearing that a third dose has operated
by a profuse perspiration, so as almost entirely to remove the
fever, but that the state of his mind continues unaltered. The
physicians, however, all agree that it must still be at least a
fortnight before they can venture even to pronounce that it is
a disorder of the brain. That even in that case they can give
no further opinion; that disorders of that sort are of all others
those that are least understood; and that this may continue for
many years, or may suddenly leave him, or as suddenly kill
him.</p>

<p>I need not tell you the effect which this dreadful calamity
produces. Pitt had yesterday a long conference with the
Prince; but it turned chiefly on the situation of the King,
and the state and progress of his disorder. Nothing passed
from which any conclusion can be drawn with respect to future
measures. He treated him with civility, but nothing more.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[Pg 442]</a></span></p>

<p>The general idea is that <i>they</i> mean to try a negotiation. But
whether the Prince means that, and whether Pitt ought in any
case to listen to it at all, or in what degree, are questions
which it is difficult indeed to decide. There could never be a
more favourable moment for Pitt's leaving the Government,
with a view to his own credit and character. But then, on
the other hand, his own personal situation must be so embarrassed:
there is so much danger of an imputation of pride, and
a factious desire of keeping alive differences, that my opinions
fluctuate almost from hour to hour. I am still, however,
inclined to believe that they will not make the experiment,
though the conversation upon it, and the general persuasion
of its being intended, make it more difficult for them to avoid
doing something of that sort.</p>

<p>The present idea is, to let Parliament meet on the 23rd,
because, indeed, no one has authority to prorogue it further.
That then it should be stated to them&mdash;supposing things to
continue in their present unhappy state&mdash;that the King's
health has not admitted either of his proroguing them, or of
his signing a Commission to open the session, and, therefore,
to propose that they should adjourn. As soon as the physicians
feel themselves able to pronounce it a disorder seated on
the brain, they must be examined before the Council, and the
circumstance stated to Parliament, and a Bill brought in to
enable the Prince of Wales to act as Regent. It seems a great
doubt whether any, and what limitations ought to be proposed.
Those under which the King was authorized to appoint a
Regent, in case of minority, appear too great; nor, indeed,
would it as I conceive be possible, in the present state of
things, to carry on such a Government. The great object to
be looked to, seems to be the keeping the Government in such
a state as that if the King's health should be restored he
might be, as far as possible, enabled to resume it, and to
conduct it in such a manner as he might judge best.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[Pg 443]</a></span></p>

<p>I suppose there never was a situation in which any set of
men ever had, at once, so many points to decide, so essentially
affecting their own honour, character, and future situation,
their duty to their country in a most critical situation, and
their duty to their unhappy master, to whom they are unquestionably
bound by ties of gratitude and honour, independent
of considerations of public duty towards him. I hope
God, who has been pleased to afflict us with this severe and
heavy trial, will enable us to go through it honestly, conscientiously,
and in a manner not dishonourable to our characters.</p>

<p>God bless you, my dear brother. Nothing would be such a
satisfaction to me as to be able to talk all this over with you,
instead of this slow and imperfect communication.</p>

<p>I found that Bernard was still in town, and have therefore
desired him to stay, because I thought he could be of little
use to me, and that all this may take a sudden turn which
may make his being on the spot very important.</p>

<p>I send you a letter which I had begun in cypher, that you
may see how far you can make it out. In going it over,
which you will observe I was doing, I observe a few mistakes,
but not, I think, such as would materially embarrass you.</p>

<p>Whitehall, Nov. 10th, 1788.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Brother</span>,</p>

<p>I have nothing of any consequence to add to the account
which I sent you yesterday by Lord Sydney's messenger. Pitt
is gone down to Windsor this morning, but will probably not
be back before the post goes out. The account of this morning
is, that the King has slept well last night, but is in other
respects much the same.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[Pg 444]</a></span></p>

<p>The last, which is a material part, shows that we have little
to hope from the effect of the medicines with respect to the
state of his mind; the consequence must be such as I mentioned
to you in my last. If Pitt makes offers to Fox, his
situation may be very difficult; but I think he should hold off
as much as he can.</p>

<p>Pray let me know your opinion on that point, and on the
various others which are connected with it. I hope I may
depend on these letters not being seen by <i>any</i> person. I have
a real confidence in Fitzherbert's honour; but I should not
write with the same freedom if I thought even he saw what I
may have to write.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>LORD BULKELEY TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.</p>

<p>Stanlake, Tuesday, Nov. 11th, 1788.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Lord</span>,</p>

<p>It was my intention to have left this place yesterday for
Baronhill, but the most natural and justifiable anxiety keeps me
here until Thursday or Friday. We have been at Windsor the
last three mornings, and sorry am I to tell you that poor Rex's
state seems worse than a thousand deaths; for unless God
interposes by some miracle, there is every appearance of his
living with the loss of his intellects. Yesterday the fever,
which had raged the day before, was abated; but the lucid
intervals were few, and lasted a very short time. I saw the
General, who was exceedingly guarded, as they all are who
really love poor Rex; the real state, however, of his melancholy
condition seems now to have transpired, and my letters from
London are full of the greatest consternation. The Queen sees
nobody but Lady Constance, Lady Charlotte Finch, Miss
Burney, and her two sons, who, I am afraid, do not announce<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[Pg 445]</a></span>
the state of the King's health with that caution and delicacy
which should be observed to the wife and the mother, and it is
to them only that she looks up. I understand her behaviour is
very feeling, decent, and proper. The Prince has taken the
command at Windsor, in consequence of which there is <i>no
command whatsoever</i>; and it was not till yesterday that orders
were given to two grooms of the bedchamber to wait for the
future and receive the inquiries of the numbers who inquire;
nor would this have been done, if Pitt and Lord Sydney had
not come down in person to beg that such orders might be
given. Unless it was done yesterday, no orders have been
given for prayers in the churches, nor for the observance of
other forms, such as stopping the playhouses, &amp;c., highly proper
at such a juncture. What the consequences of this heavy
misfortune will be to Government, you are more likely to know
than I am; but I cannot help thinking that the Prince will
find a greater difficulty in making a sweep of the present
Ministry, in his quality of Fiduciary Regent, than in that of
King. The Stocks are already fallen 2 per cent, and the alarms
of the people of London are very little flattering to the Prince.
I am told messenger after messenger has been sent for Fox,
who is touring with Mrs. Armstead on the continent; but I
have not heard whether the Prince has sent for him, or given
any orders to Fox's friends to that effect. The system of
favouritism is much changed since Lord Bute's and the Princess-Dowager's
time, for Jack Payne, Master Leigh, an Eton
schoolboy, and Master Barry, brother to Lord Barrymore, and
Mrs. Fitz, form the Cabinet at Carlton House.</p>

<p>I am, my dear Lord,<br/>
Sincerely yours,<br/>

<p>The account of to-day is in every particular exactly the same
with that of yesterday. The disorder in the brain is increased.
The Cabinet is to meet on Thursday, to receive the report of the
physicians; a Privy Council will be called for Monday or
Tuesday.</p>

<p>Parliament must meet on Thursday sevennight, to which day
it now stands prorogued; and it will then, I imagine, adjourn
itself. I wait with impatience to hear from you. I am called
off, and prevented from writing any more.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>MR. NEVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.</p>

<p>Windsor Castle,</p>

<p>Wednesday, Nov. 11th, Four o'clock, 1788.</p>

<p>The King had more sleep last night than the night before;
but is in other respects the same as before. I fear there is
very little hope of amendment, as he has no fever, and his
pulse and appetite are as good as ever. The King had some
lucid intervals this morning, conversing with great composure
with a page, whom he recollected but to have seen since his
illness; and he also mentioned his son, Prince Augustus, who
is going to the South of France. He soon, however, returned
to his unfortunate agitation and delirium, in which he still
continues. Sad state!</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>LORD SYDNEY TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.</p>

<p>(Secret and Separate.) Whitehall, Nov. 13th, 1788.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Lord</span>,</p>

<p>I am not at all surprised that your Excellency should
participate in the distress, which every honest man feels upon
the present unhappy state of the King's health. The account,
however, of this morning is rather more favourable than those
of some days past; though certainly not such as to lay any
part of our anxiety at rest. There does not, however, appear
any symptoms which seem to threaten His Majesty's life with
immediate danger. He had more fever yesterday than for some
days past, but since it has subsided, he has been in a state of
more composure than before.</p>

<p>The Parliament will meet this day sevennight, and adjourn;
if in the intermediate time there should not be an opportunity
of receiving His Majesty's pleasure for a prorogation.</p>

<p>You may easily believe that the hurry and ferment is great
at present. People in general, of all ranks, seem to be truly
sensible of the calamitous effects to be dreaded from an
unfavourable termination of His Majesty's disorder. But, as
you may easily imagine, there are not wanting those who are
thinking of extracting <i>good</i> to <i>themselves</i> out of this misfortune;
nor are they over anxious to conceal their eagerness to accomplish
their ends. I am old enough to have been in the scene
on a demise of the Crown, an event which does not bring the
virtues of men more into light than the contrary qualities. I
do not promise myself a more agreeable picture of mankind,
than one which I have never thought of but with disgust and
detestation.</p>

<p>I refer your Excellency to my official despatch for the
business which has passed in a Committee of the Privy Council
to-day, on the subject of a prayer. The Dissenters and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[Pg 448]</a></span>
Jews have begun upon that subject already. Indeed every
demonstration of alarm and affection has been shown through
the whole town, and, as far as can be learned, in all parts of
the country.</p>

<p>I am, with the truest esteem and regard, my dear Lord,<br/>
Your most obedient humble servant,<br/>
<span class="smcap">Sydney</span>.</p></div>

<p>The next letter from Mr. Grenville is of special importance;
he lays down the whole plan of the Ministry in
reference to the proposed Regency, developing and investigating
the arguments with remarkable clearness and
penetration.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>MR. W. W. GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.</p>

<p>Whitehall, Nov. 13th, 1788.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Brother</span>,</p>

<p>Your messenger has performed his journey with uncommon
expedition, and brought me your letters at a little after eleven
this morning. The account of to-day is, I think, more favourable
than that of the two preceding days. The King had last
night a strong return of his fever, which left him this morning
more composed than he has been for several days. Warren's
account adds that he even "understood questions that were put
to him, though he soon relapsed into his former inconsistency."
The material part of this, I think, is that it proves him never
to have been without fever, though it has been kept under, and
therefore affords ground still to hope for such a crisis as may
end this scene, either by his death or by his total recovery.
And there can be no doubt that even, for his sake, either of
those alternatives is preferable to his continuing in his present
situation, though with the possibility of recovering his reason
by intervals.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[Pg 449]</a></span></p>

<p>This circumstance affords an additional and strong reason
for delaying as long as possible the taking any decisive steps
for providing for carrying on the Government under the present
circumstances. It is intended to meet Parliament on the 20th,
and circular letters are to be sent to-day to all the members,
notifying the probability of this. But, as things now stand,
Pitt means immediately to propose to them to adjourn; and it
is most likely that this will meet with no opposition, especially
as Fox cannot be in town by that time.</p>

<p>If the present circumstances should still continue, Pitt means
to propose a Bill, declaring the Prince of Wales Regent, or
Guardian, to exercise the King's authority during his illness,
but in the King's name only. We have, I think, not yet
entirely made up our minds as to the degree of power and
authority which it will be right to put into his hands for that
purpose. That it cannot be necessary to invest him with the
whole regal authority, is, I think, quite evident; and we owe it
to the King, both as public men professing allegiance to him,
and as individuals bound to him by many ties of gratitude and
honour, to take whatever steps we can with propriety to
preserve to him, in case of his recovery, not merely his legal
rights, of which he cannot be deprived, but also the political
means of exercising those rights according to the opinions
which he entertains both of public men and public measures.
And to this extent I am inclined to hope that the general
opinion will bear us out; but we must be extremely cautious
that we do nothing which shall bear in the public estimation
the appearance of wishing to establish ourselves under this
pretence in the continuance of our power in opposition to the
Prince of Wales, in whom we are to propose the supreme
authority to be vested. All the precedents, as far as they apply
to this case, would justify the appointment of a Council of
Regency, to be named by Parliament, by the majority of which
the Regent would be bound. And I think it is not clear that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[Pg 450]</a></span>
in all events we shall not be obliged, by the strong analogy to
be drawn from some of those cases, to provide some such
Council. But it seems now to be agreed that we ought not to
propose their being named by Parliament, because that would
be in effect to propose that the executive authority should be
vested by Parliament in our hands, instead of those of the
Prince of Wales. Such a proposition would be difficult to
carry, and might be seen by the public in such a light as
materially and permanently to affect our characters. Besides
this, what is more important even than these considerations, is,
that on the fullest consideration, we are persuaded such a
proposal ought not to be made, and would, if carried, be
injurious to the country. Examine the provisions of the last
Regency Bill, and you will, I think, be convinced that the
present Government, being joined in such a Council with the
Prince of Wales and the Royal Family, could produce nothing
but discord, confusion and anarchy; and that on such a plan
the administration of public affairs cannot proceed.</p>

<p>This line of argument leads to the nomination of the Prince
of Wales, either without a Council, or with a Council, consisting
only of the Cabinet Ministers for the time being, and removable
by him, limiting at the same time his authority in other respects
in such a manner as may not be inconsistent with the means of
carrying on a temporary Government; but may provide in the
manner I have already mentioned for securing to the King, in
case of his recovery, the possession and exercise of his rights,
such as he enjoyed them before his illness. The means of doing
this appear to be the restraining the Prince from granting any
office or pension for life, or in reversion, except those only which
must by law be granted either for life, or during good behaviour;
restraining him from creating or advancing peers, and, perhaps,
from dissolving the present or any future Parliament. The last
of these points appear to be that which admits of most doubt,
whether it should be stated to the extent which I have mentioned,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[Pg 451]</a></span>
or whether it should be confined to this Parliament, or
should be entirely omitted. My own opinion, I think, rather
leans to inserting it in its full extent, though I see and confess
that there are weighty objections to it.</p>

<p>I have now mentioned to you all I know of our views and
intentions on this most important subject. The next point
relates to our own situation. We have no knowledge at all, any
more than when I wrote to you before, of the Prince of Wales's
intentions, nor has any overture, direct or indirect, been made to
Mr. Pitt. This circumstance, joined to the affectation with
which Sheridan appears to be consulted on all occasions, seems
sufficiently to indicate what is to be expected. A part of this,
however, is to be attributed to Sheridan's eagerness to display
his personal importance, by which silly vanity I am told he has
much offended the Duke of Portland and Fox's immediate
friends.</p>

<p>We are therefore still much in doubt whether there is any
idea of proposing terms of junction. We are all agreed that
the most desirable thing would be, that Pitt should be removed
at once, and without management. The difficulties of a real
<i>bon&acirc; fide</i> junction appear insuperable, and in anything short of
that, duplicity and dishonesty might give them advantages
which, though we should not certainly envy, yet we might have
much cause to lament. There is, however, one circumstance
arising from the present state of things which, if that should
continue, will, I think, afford a clear and distinct line for us to
follow. The King's illness being such as it is now described to
be, it is not only possible, but much the most probable event,
that he will at some period be restored to the use of his reason,
either permanently, or during intervals of considerable length.
Under this impression, it seems impossible for us for a moment
to entertain proposals which might involve us in contradictory
obligations, and our acceptance of which might be not only
injurious to the King's feelings, which we are so much bound<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[Pg 452]</a></span>
to consult, but even prejudicial to the state of his mind. Suppose
him to awake out of the sort of dream, in which he now is,
and to find that Pitt had, by his own consent and his own act,
brought into his Government those very men whom he was
pledged to him to keep at a distance from it; suppose the
King's aversion and dislike to those men, so justly founded as
it is, to remain in full force and vigour. What then is Pitt to
do? Is he to separate himself from people whom he has joined
on the promise of mutual good faith and confidence, or is he to
abandon the King in the very point to which he has pledged
him, and on which he has always received from him a full and
unequivocal support? Besides the difficulties in which Pitt
would thus find himself involved, must not the very idea of such
a situation striking the King's imagination at the first moments
of his recovery, and agitating him in the same manner as these
very situations have done before, drive him back into his former
state, and render all further hopes of recovery desperate and
impossible?</p>

<p>This consideration I think unanswerable, and have no doubt
that it will continue to be so felt. In the case, therefore, of a
Regency, all proposals of junction will instantly be negatived as
inconsistent with our duty to the King. In the case of a
demise, which there is to-day more reason to think probable
than there has been for several days past, we shall feel ourselves
considerably embarrassed. I put the idea of a <i>bon&acirc; fide</i>
junction, as I have already said, wholly out of the question,
being persuaded that the thing is impossible, and that our opponents
will never seriously intend it. Their proposals, if any are
made, will, I am convinced, have no other object than that
perhaps of satisfying the Prince of Wales, if your information
respecting him is well grounded, and of lessening the odium of
Pitt's removal in the eyes of the public, and holding him out as
a haughty and impracticable character. Against this he must
defend himself as well as he can, but the whole will, I am persuaded,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[Pg 453]</a></span>
be nothing more than a match at fencing; and the
guard which I mentioned to you before, of insisting on his
present situation, seems as good a one as any other. I have
delivered to him your letter, and shown him that which you
wrote to me. He has desired me to say that he will, if possible,
write a few words to you by this messenger, but if he should
find that quite impossible, without delaying him, he has begged
me to express how strongly he feels your kind and affectionate
conduct towards him.</p>

<p>His popularity was never greater than in the present
moment, and if the Prince should be so ill-advised as to
dismiss him, it is probable that the current will run at least
as strongly in his favour as it did in his father's.</p>

<p>I have written you a dissertation rather than a letter, but I
know the desire which you must feel to be as fully informed as
possible, not only of facts, but also of opinions and intentions.
I need not mention to you how confidential every part of this
letter is, but particularly that part which respects our intentions as
to the settlement of a Regency; because we conceive it of the
utmost importance, though these and many other ideas are
floating in the public, to keep our enemies as ignorant as we
can of our real intentions in this respect.</p>

<p>Of the different questions which you have stated respecting
Ireland, in the case of a demise, you will certainly be much
better able to judge than I am; but I cannot help wishing you
to look into the Act of Settlement in Queen Anne's time, and
to consider whether that does not provide for the continuance of
Irish officers, civil and military, as well as English.</p>

<p>In the case of a Regency, my idea is that as soon as the
King's illness is communicated to Parliament here, which will
not be till after the adjournment, directions should be given to
the Lord-Lieutenant and Council of Ireland to assemble the
two Houses by special summons; and that our Bill, whatever it
is, should be communicated to them in a speech from the Lord-Lieutenant,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[Pg 454]</a></span>
and should be passed <i>verbatim</i> in the Irish
Parliament. Some opinions here seem to doubt the necessity
of this; there has, however, been very little discussion
upon it.</p>

<p>You will easily see the impossibility of doing anything about
your commissions, which must share the fate of many others in
England. I much fear that Tompkins's office at Chelsea will
stand in this predicament. The form is, that a recommendation
goes from this office to the Secretary of State, who takes the
King's pleasure upon it. The first step has been taken, but the
latter has been impossible. If my successor is a gentleman, he
will confirm the appointment; but the chances are so much
against that, that I almost despair.</p>

<p>Adieu, my dear brother.<br/>
Believe me ever most affectionately yours,<br/>
W. W. G.</p>

<p>I had written before your messenger arrived a long letter in
cypher, which this opportunity of writing will save you the
labour of decyphering. In case, however, we should want to
use the cypher any more, pray add the following names:

<div class="blockquot"><p>MR. W. W. GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.</p>

<p>Whitehall, Nov. 14th, 1788.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Brother</span>,</p>

<p>By a cursed blunder of Lord Sydney's messenger, he went
away last night without calling for my letter. Lord Sydney
sends another man to-day; but I have resolved to keep him
till I can send you this morning's account. That of yesterday
evening was, I think, in so far favourable, as it clearly shows
that the King is no longer in that settled state of derangement<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[Pg 455]</a></span>
without other disease, which was most to be apprehended, but
that his disorder is taking some turn, and whatever that may
ultimately be, it must be far more desirable than the continuance
of his former state. I am assured, that it was last
night the opinion of medical people, that the turn which seemed
probable was one from which it was not too sanguine to hope
the best effects. I do not, however, indulge this idea too far.</p>

<p>I mentioned yesterday, to Mornington, your kind intentions
towards him. He will write to you, to explain his situation
fully.</p>

<p>Pitt is gone down this morning to Windsor.</p>

<p>Ever most affectionately yours,<br/>
W. W. G.</p>

<p>You will be, perhaps, surprised to hear that Pitt has received
a very handsome letter from Lord Chesterfield, dated from
Weymouth, stating the alarm there for the King's life; and
desiring Pitt to do him the justice of believing him in that and
every other contingency, sincerely and personally attached to
him. I am not without hopes, that this may be improved into
a decided support of your interest in case of a contest; but you
well know the difficulties with which this would be attended.</p>

<p>I have just received the copy of the paper sent to St. James's,
which is by no means such as one could wish it. I wait for a
more particular account before I send this off.</p>

<p>One o'clock.</p>

<p>I now send off the messenger, though with little more
intelligence than before; but this is all I can get till Pitt
returns from Windsor, which may not be till late at night.</p></div>

<p>Here is Lord Mornington's letter, alluded to by Mr.
Grenville.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[Pg 456]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>LORD MORNINGTON TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.</p>

<p>Hertford Street, Nov. 15th, 1788.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Lord</span>,</p>

<p>Grenville has informed me of a new and most flattering
instance of your regard for me; you may well conceive how
sensibly I feel the value of the offer of a seat from you, in the
event of Grenville's failure in the county; and I should certainly
at once throw myself on the chance of his success,
(which, I trust, cannot be doubtful), if I did not feel it to
be my duty to strain every nerve in the general cause, and to
the utmost extent of my ability to increase our numbers in the
House of Commons, by purchasing a seat for myself.</p>

<p>If the King should remain in his present unhappy state of
mind, and the Parliament be either dissolved, or expire by its
natural death under the government of a Regent, I shall
think myself, under those circumstances, bound, by my respect
for the person who placed me at Windsor, to endeavour to
preserve that seat for him; that he may find his own friends,
where he was pleased to leave them, whenever he may happen
to recover his reason. But I might fail in this attempt to
maintain the trust reposed in me, and the expense of the attempt
might be such as to disable me from purchasing any other
seat; in that case your offer would be most acceptable.</p>

<p>My brother Pole has found an opening in a borough, long
the property of Anderson Pelham (Grimsby); and there is
every reason to suppose, indeed I think it certain, that Pitt,
in any event, will have two seats at that place at the general
election for about &pound;5000. My brother is able to advance &pound;1000
of this money, and I mean to give him &pound;1500, which will bring
him in; another friend of Pitt's agrees to pay the remaining
money for the other seat. By these means, as far as I am able,
I have secured a vote which will count as well as mine, whatever<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[Pg 457]</a></span>
misfortune may befal me. It has, however, been necessary
to take immediate steps for the attainment of this object; and
my brother and Mr. Wood are to be at Grimsby on Monday
next. Now, if any sudden stroke should produce a dissolution
of Parliament (which is possible), I might find myself unable,
from the shortness of the notice, to raise a larger sum than the
&pound;1500 necessary for my brother's election. In this case also,
your offer would afford me a most desirable resource.</p>

<p>You will perceive that I have stated to you the whole of my
situation openly, and without reserve; and you will, I am persuaded,
understand that I should gladly embrace any occasion
of uniting more closely my political fortunes with your protection;
but I think you will agree, that it is my duty to endeavour in
the first instance to strengthen the general cause in which we
are all embarked, and the support of which at this moment
presses most strongly on every feeling of public and private
honour, and affection.</p>

<p>Grenville has given you (I suppose) to-day the improved
accounts of the King's health; I really think them very encouraging,
and it seems to be the general opinion.</p>

<p>Ever, my dear Lord,<br/>
Your most obliged and affectionate friend,<br/>
<span class="smcap">Mornington</span>.
